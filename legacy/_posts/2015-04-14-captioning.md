## Overview

We want to expand our accessibility support to include closed captioning support. We need to support live and recorded captioning.

## Proposed Features

### Client

* Viewer
  * size, color, font, upper/lower case, locale
  * Do we show when the last message was received?
* Operator
    * Input
        * Use a TextBox
        * Type the content and press enter to submit
        * Need to be able to revoke the last line
        * Should revoking put the last line into the text box for editing or just delete?
    * Editing
        * Use a TextArea
        * Use the Text_Input method mainly
        * Need to be able to edit any past text
        * Need to be able to add lines in-between published text
        * Has to handle cut, copy, and paste
* Layout
  * Make sure that closed caption window is excluded from layout sync so as not to hide/move window when presenter/moderator decides to change the layout.

### Recording
* Processing
    * Needs to take new messages into consideration somehow if the recording was turned off for that section
    * Needs to take corrections into consideration when building the final file
    * Corrections could be outside of the record start/stop event pairs
    * Corrections will be 0 or more characters and be a substring replace
    * If a new line is added it should push any lines equal or greater down the list
    * A lineâ€™s number is not constant through the meeting
* Post-Processing
    * We need a link to download the transcript
        * SRT is the most popular transcript format
        * We could offer a choice
    * We need a way to edit the transcript after the meeting has finished
        * Possibly download and reupload the correctly chunked version
        * Or upload a new transcription for meeting that had no live transcription
