BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for online learning.

The goal of the project is to enable remote students to have a high-quality online learning experience.  A key component of achieving this goal is giving the instructor the tools to engage remote students during the session.  

This document gives you an overview of what’s new in BigBlueButton 2.0-beta (hereafter referred to as BigBlueButton 2.0) of features we added towards that goal.

# BigBlueButton 2.0

We added three new features for increasing ease-of-use and user engagement: 

 * Improved User Interface (easy-of-use)
 * Multi-user Whiteboard (engagement)
 * Shared Notes (engagement)

## Improved User Interface

One measure of a successful user interface is how little effort it takes new users to master it.  

While we’ve spent years building and improving features in BigBlueButton, we had not done a comprehensive review of the overall design during that time.  Until now.

In BigBlueButton 2.0, we’ve updated every pixel of the interface with improved skin and high-res icon set.  The overall user interface should now look more coherent and consistent, which gives the user a uniform design language through that enables them to anticipate (and intuit) how functions work.

![overview](/images/20-overview.png)

In addition to updated skin and icons, we’ve simplified the dialog boxes, so they are easier to navigate.  For example, the new join audio dialog box shows two large icons for easy choice.

![audio](/images/20-audio.png)

All icons are now rendered from vectors; they appear crisp even on the highest resolution monitors. 

For consistency, the actions for sharing audio, webcam, and desktop (when you are the presenter) are now grouped together at the top middle of the screen.  The meeting title is on the left, and the record button is on the right.

![buttons](/images/20-buttons.png)

We’ve simplified the layout of the Users list by removing the unneeded headers (it's obvious what the icons for headset and microphone mean).

![20-users](/images/20-20-users.png)

In addition to improving the overall design, we've added several features that have been requested by our community (outlined below).

### Enable Presentation Download

The presenter can now give students the ability to download a presentation.

When uploading a presentation, the presenter can check "Enable download of presentation".

![enable-download](/images/20-enable-download.png)

If this option is checked, a download button will appear for all users in the Presentation area.  

![download-button](/images/20-download-button.png)

Later on, when a user clicks the download button, BigBlueButton will display a dialog giving the user the ability to download any presentation that was enabled for download.

![download-dialog](/images/20-download-dialog.png)

The moderator can now enable users invited to the breakout rooms to choose which room they join.

![Breakout Room](/images/20-choose-breakout.png)

When users receive the invitation, they will have a drop-down menu from which to choose a specific breakout room to join.

![Breakout Invite](/images/20-breakout-invite.png)

### Smoothing of Pen Tool

BigBlueButton smooths all strokes of the pen tool.  When drawing with the pen you'll see it work as before, but when you release the mouse, BigBlueButton will smooth the lines a bit.

![smooth](/images/20-smooth.png)

This smoothing makes math equations and diagrams a bit easier to read for students.

### Promote Viewer to Moderator

Moderators have now the ability to promote/demote any viewer to the role of moderator.  To promote a viewer, click the gear icon to the right of a user’s name and choose “Promote”.

![user-promote](/images/20-user-promote.png)

Later on, any moderator can demote the same user back to a viewer by choosing the “Demote” option from the gear icon. 

![user-demote](/images/20-user-demote.png)

### Download Public Chat Messages

In previous versions BigBlueButton enabled users to copy chat to the clipboard by right-clicking anywhere on the Chat area and selecting `Copy All Text`.

In BigBlueButton 2.0, the Options tab now gives users a button for copying public chat messages to the clipboard (which makes the function more accessible for users with screen readers).  

![chat-options](/images/20-chat-options.png) 

Next to the copy button there are two others buttons

   1. Download the public chat as plain text
   1. Delete public chat (moderator only)


### End Meeting on Logout

Ever wanted to end the meeting and kick out all users.  Now, when anyone who is moderator logs out, they will have the option to immediately end the session.

![end-logout](/images/20-end-logout.png)

Selecting "Yes and end meeting" will cause BigBlueButton to immediately end the session, which in turn kicks out all other users and initiates the processing of the recording (if the meeting was set to be recorded).


### Full Screen Mode

Users can now have BigBlueButton take the entire screen with the Full Screen button.

![full-screen](/images/20-full-screen.png)

Clicking this button causes BigBlueButton to take over the full screen (this invokes the browser's built-in full screen capability).  

When users click the Full Screen button, the browser displays a confirmation dialog on the switch to full screen mode.

![full-screen-exit](/images/20-full-screen-exit.png)

Users can exit full screen mode anytime by pressing the ESC key.

### Right to left languages support

Users that are used to languages written from right to left like Arabic and Hebrew will be able to use BigBlueButton in their mother tongue. It is possible to write in those languages without any issue, however mirroring the layout from right to left remains experimental.

![rtl-support](/images/20-rtl-screen.png) 

# Shared Notes

Active learning is more effective than passively watching a lecture.   Engaging students to recall and apply what they just learned re-enforces new concepts and ideas.  Breakout rooms are an example of having students engage in discussion.

BigBlueButton 2.0 adds a new layout called “Shared Notes”, which gives students a collaborative note pad capturing content during the session. 

Shared notes are visible by choosing the “Shared Notes” layout.

![shared-notes-create](/images/20-shared-notes-layout.png)

When choosing this layout, the Shared Notes window appears on the left-hand side.  Any user can write/edit in the window at the same time.

![shared-notes-window](/images/20-shared-notes-window.png)

Think of them as a collaborative notepad during the live session.  Shared notes are not saved as part of the recording.  

Any moderator can clear the shared notes using the "Clear this note" option in the gear icon (this icon is only visible to moderators).

![shared-notes-clear](/images/20-shared-notes-clear.png)


## Multiple Shared Notes

A moderator can launch (up to) two additional shared notes windows. Clicking this button opens a new window called “Shared Notes 2” and “Shared Notes 3” (you can name them whatever you wish).

![shared-notes-create](/images/20-shared-notes-create.png)

When this option is selected, the moderator can name the new shared note window.

![shared-notes-create](/images/20-shared-notes-name.png)

The two additional windows will be visible across layouts.

## Text Formatting

The Shared Notes window allows users to apply formatting changes (font, font size, and style) to any of the text in the shared notes.

![shared-notes-format](/images/20-shared-notes-format.png)


## Download Shared Notes

Users can also download the content of the shared notes as plain text or HTML.

![shared-notes-download](/images/20-shared-notes-download.png)

The download option lets users save the shared notes for later use.  As stated above, shared notes are not saved as part of the recording - they are cleared from memory when the meeting ends.


# Multi-user Whiteboard

Another form of student engagement is getting user kinetically involved in the lecture.  This is especially true of K12 students who may have a hard time sitting and watching a lecture without involvement.  

BigBlueButton 2.0 now supports multiple users updating the whiteboard in real-time.  This enables a tutor, for example, to collaboratively work together with a student on a math problem.

To enable/disable multi-user whiteboard, the presenter clicks the Multi-User Whiteboard button on the toolbar.

![mu-button](/images/20-mu-button.png)

When engaged, all users can annotate the current slide.  The User’s names will appear to the right of their cursor.

![mu-over](/images/20-mu-over.png)

Users can only clear their own whiteboard marks (by clicking the ‘X’ button).  

If the presenter clicks the ‘X’ icon when multi-user whiteboard is turned off, BigBlueButton will clear all marks by all users.

The recording format for BigBlueButton 2.0 is updated to record and playback all multi-user whiteboard annotations.

# HTML5 client

Built upon the 2.0 release, the HTML5 client let's viewers participate in BigBlueButton sessions from mobile devices.  For more information see [HTML5 Client](/html/html5-overview.html) along with installation instructions.

You can configure BigBlueButton 2.0-beta to only load the HTML5 client by editing `/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties` and set the following two parameters to `true`.

~~~
# Force all attendees to join the meeting using the HTML5 client
attendeesJoinViaHTML5Client=true

# Force all moderators to join the meeting using the HTML5 client
moderatorsJoinViaHTML5Client=true
~~~

After making the edit, do `sudo bbb-conf --restart` to reload the settings.  Any front-end using BigBlueButton will automatically launch the HTML5 client on desktop and mobile.

# Miscellaneous

## API

### getMeetings

The `getMeetings` API call now returns a union of the previous `getMeetings` and `getMeetingInfo` in a single API call.  

In BigBlueButton version 1.1, if you wanted to get a snapshot of all meeting and user activity on your server, you needed to do a `getMeetings` API call and then iterate through each meeting and do a `getMeetingsInfo` API call. 

In BigBlueButton 2.0, you can now do a single `getMeetings` API call to get all the data in one call.

Here is a `getMeetings` call with one active meeting with two uers.

~~~xml

         <isBreakout>false</isBreakout>
      </meeting>
   </meetings>
</response>
~~~

## Reduced reconnect time

We've refactored some of the code to reconnect the client when one of the RTMP connections drop.  Instead of waiting 10 seconds it will now wait 2 seconds.  This parameter is configurable by editing `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config.xml` and setting the value for `reconnWaitTime`.

~~~xml
    <application uri="rtmp://s77-good.freddixon.ca/bigbluebutton" host="https://s77-good.freddixon.ca/bigbluebutton/api/enter" reconnWaitTime="2000"/>
~~~

This change reduces the pause in the client when a reconnect occurs.


## defaultMaxUsers

In previous versions, the value for `defaultMaxUsers` in `bigbluebutton.properties` (located in `/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.propreties`) was not used.  

~~~
# Default maximum number of users a meeting can have.
# Current default is 0 (meeting doesn't have a user limit).
defaultMaxUsers=0
~~~

In BigBlueButton 2.0 the server will enforce the value and, if the maximum limit is reached, redirect the user to the following URL 

~~~
   https://IP_or_HOSTNAME/?errors=[{"message":"The number of participants allowed for this meeting has been reached.","key":"maxParticipantsReached"}]
~~~

A value of `defaultMaxUsers=0` means the server will not enforce the limit.

## Refactoring of messages

In BigBlueButton 2.0 we have refactored the messaging format used to communicate between the different server components and between the client and server. The goal of this was to streamline the creation and processing of messages which in previous versions required a lot of steps. The end result is a much easier system to work with that allows for quicker edits and additions. 

## More efficient processing of recordings

BigBlueButton 1.1, there was one thread that would archive all recordings, then process them, then publish them.  If there were many recordings to process, they would all need to finish processing (which could take many hours) before any would publish.

In BigBlueButton 2.0, the archive, process, and publish steps for creating a published recording now occur in parallel.  This means there are three threads now, one for each step, and they execute in parallel.  

## Branding

We've made it easier to brand your BigBlueButton 2.0 client.  You can now change the logo 

![logo](/images/20logo.png)

and copyright text 

![logo](/images/20copyright.png)

by modifying the `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config.xml`.  To modify, edit this file and look for the XML tag `branding`.

~~~xml
<branding logo="logo.swf" copyright="&#169; 2017 &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigbluebutton.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.bigbluebutton.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; (build {0})" background="bbb_logo.png" toolbarColor="#F0F2F6" showQuote="true"/>
~~~

You can change the parameters:

  * `logo` : The logo file name. It will be displayed in the higher left-hand corner. JPEG, PNG, BMP and SWF files are accepted. The recommended maximum height is 35 pixels. Default location is `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/logo.swf`
  * `copyright` : The copyright mention that will be displayed in the lower left-hand corner of the footer. It accepts HTML but should be HTML-encoded. The `{0}` token will be replaced by the build number when the application is launched.
  * `background` : The background image name. It will be displayed behind the windows. JPEG, PNG, BMP and SWF files are accepted.
  * `toolbarColor` : The background colour of the top toolbar. Must be an hexadecimal value that starts with a `#`.
  * `showQuote` Show the initial quote on startup

After changing, refresh the browser (no need to restart BigBlueButton) and you'll see the changes take effect.

## Support for (up to) 8 breakout rooms

The number of supported breakout rooms is increased from 5 to 8 rooms.

![mu-over](/images/20-breakout-8.png)

## Gather User Feedback

We've expanded the logout dialog to solicit feedback from the user on their experience.  The user can rate the experience from 1 to 5 stars (similar to Amazon Consumer Rating) 

![rate](/images/20-feedback1.png)

When clicked, a dialog box appears asking if there is anything specific that could be improved

![feedback](/images/20-feedback2.png)

You can enable the display of the feedback dialog by setting askForFeedbackOnLogout to `true`

~~~
  askForFeedbackOnLogout="true"
~~~

The responses to the feedback are sent to the BigBlueButton server via the [client logging](/overview/overview.html#client-logging)

A sample entry in the client log comes in with escaped characters.

~~~

~~~

## Webcams only visible to moderators

There are occasions where the moderator does not want viewers to see each other's webcams.  A case might be that the students are all in the same classroom and sharing their webcams.  If there were 10 students sharing webcams, it would be 10 outgoing video streams to the BigBlueButton server and 90 incoming video streams to the same classroom.  

This release adds an option in the lock settings to lock the viewer's webcams, so they are only visible to moderators.

![webcams only for moderators](/images/20-webcams-moderator-only.png)

## Limit moderator actions in breakout rooms

All users in a breakout room join as moderators.  To make remove unintended results for K12 users, removed two moderator capabilities: demoting others to viewers and kicking out other users.  

Also added the ability to restrict private chat in breakout rooms by setting `privateChateEnabled` to `true` in `config.xml`.

~~~
    <breakoutRooms enabled="true" record="false" privateChateEnabled="true"/>
~~~

## Locked private chat does not prevent chatting with moderators

When a moderator locks down the ability for viewers to private chat with each other, they can still engage in private chat with the moderator.  Usually the only moderator in a room is the teacher, so this means that students can still do private chat with the teacher when private chat is locked down.

# Recording formats

We've added two new recording formats: podcast and screensharing.

## Podcast

This format gives an audio file of the recording.  You can install with with

~~~
  sudo apt-get install bbb-playback-podcast
~~~

## Screenshare

This format gives a video file that is a composite of the screensharing, webcams, and audio.  You can install with with

~~~
  sudo apt-get install bbb-playback-screenshare
~~~


# Setting up a development environment for BigBlueButton 2.0.  

Here are the steps for [setting up a development environment in BigBlueButton 2.0](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Updated components

Many of the core components of BigBlueButton have been updated to their latest release. This includes red5 1.0.10, FreeSWITCH 1.6.20, kurento 6.7, and mkclean 0.8.10.

# WebRTC Screen Sharing

We are building in support for the BigBlueButton Flash client to use the built-in WebRTC capabilities of the browser (in Firefox and Chrome) to share the stream.  Using the built-in capabilities does not require externally launching to Java.

The WebRTC screen sharing is currently disabled by default (choosing screen sharing goes directly to launching the external applet).  To enable WebRTC screen sharing, edit `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config.xml` and change

~~~
offerWebRTC="false"
~~~

to 

~~~
offerWebRTC="true"
~~~

When WebRTC screen sharing is enabled, and when a presenter uses Firefox or Chrome, they will have an option of using WebRTC to share their screen.  

![Choice](/images/20-screenshare-choice.png)

When choosing WebRTC on Chrome, the presenter will be giving a dialog to select which screen to share in a floating window.

![Chrome](/images/20-chrome-select.png)

When choosing WebRTC on Firefox, the presenter will be giving a dialog to select which screen to share from a drop-down menu.

![Chrome](/images/20-firefox-select.png)

When WebRTC screen sharing starts, both the presenter and viewers will see the presenter's screen.  As with Java-based screen sharing, the presenter will see a small preview window of what the viewers are seeing.
