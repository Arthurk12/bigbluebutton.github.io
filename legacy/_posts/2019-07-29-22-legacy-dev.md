*The following document is only required if you're interested in developing the legacy Flash client and it's associated projects.*

# Legacy Tools

You need to make a directory to hold the tools needed for BigBlueButton Flash client development.

~~~
mkdir -p ~/dev/tools
cd ~/dev/tools
~~~

In the next step, you need to get the Apache Flex 4.13.0 SDK package. 

First, you need to download the SDK tarball from an Apache mirror site and then unpack it.

~~~
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/flex/4.13.0/binaries/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin.tar.gz
tar xvfz apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin.tar.gz
~~~

Once the Apache Flex SDK is unpacked, you need to download one of the dependencies manually because the file was moved from its original URL.

~~~
wget --content-disposition https://github.com/swfobject/swfobject/archive/2.2.tar.gz
tar xvfz swfobject-2.2.tar.gz
cp -r swfobject-2.2/swfobject apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/templates/
~~~

Now that we've finished with the first dependency we need to download the Adobe Flex SDK.  We'll do this step manually in case the download fails (if it does, remove the incomplete file and issue the `wget` command again).

~~~
cd apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/
mkdir -p in/
wget http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flex/sdk/builds/flex4.6/flex_sdk_4.6.0.23201B.zip -P in/
~~~

Once the supplementary SDK has downloaded, we can use its `build.xml` script to automatically download the remaining third-party tools.

~~~
ant -f frameworks/build.xml thirdparty-downloads
~~~

After Flex downloads the remaining third-party tools, you need to modify their permissions.

~~~
find ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin -type d -exec chmod o+rx '{}' \;
chmod 755 ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/bin/*
chmod -R +r ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin
~~~

Next, create a linked directory with a shortened name for easier referencing.

~~~
ln -s ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin ~/dev/tools/flex
~~~

The next step in setting up the Flex SDK environment is to download a Flex library for video.

~~~
mkdir -p ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/frameworks/libs/player/11.2
cd ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/frameworks/libs/player/11.2
wget http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/installers/archive/playerglobal/playerglobal11_2.swc
mv -f playerglobal11_2.swc playerglobal.swc
~~~

The last step to have a working Flex SDK is to configure it to work with playerglobal 11.2

~~~
cd ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin
sed -i "s/11.1/11.2/g" frameworks/flex-config.xml
sed -i "s/<swf-version>14<\/swf-version>/<swf-version>15<\/swf-version>/g" frameworks/flex-config.xml
sed -i "s/{playerglobalHome}\/{targetPlayerMajorVersion}.{targetPlayerMinorVersion}/libs\/player\/11.2/g" frameworks/flex-config.xml
~~~

With the tools installed, you need to add a set of environment variables to your `.profile` to access these tools.

~~~
vi ~/.profile
~~~

Copy-and-paste the following text at bottom of `.profile`.

~~~

export FLEX_HOME=$HOME/dev/tools/flex
export PATH=$PATH:$FLEX_HOME/bin


export ANT_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"

~~~

Reload your profile to use these tools (this will happen automatically when you next login).

~~~
source ~/.profile
~~~

Check that the tools are now in your path by running the following command.

~~~
$ mxmlc -version
Version 4.13.0 build 20140701
~~~

# Flash Client Development

This section will walk you through making a simple change to the BigBlueButton Flash client.

## Setting up the environment

The first thing you need to do is to copy the template `config.xml` file to the build directory for the client.

~~~
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/
cp bigbluebutton-client/resources/config.xml.template bigbluebutton-client/src/conf/config.xml
~~~

The `config.xml` file is one of the first files loaded by the BigBlueButton client when it connects to the server.  The `config.xml` file tells BigBlueButton client how to load the remaining components (such as chat module, deskshare module, video conf module, etc.) and sets a number of configuration parameters for each component.  The `config.xml` specifies the hostname (or IP address) for loading each component.

Let's look at the first ten lines of the `config.xml` file you just copied.

~~~
$ head -n 10 bigbluebutton-client/src/conf/config.xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<config>
    <localeversion suppressWarning="false">0.9.0</localeversion>
    <version>VERSION</version>
    <help url="http://HOST/help.html"/>
    <javaTest url="http://HOST/testjava.html"/>
    <porttest host="HOST" application="video/portTest" timeout="10000"/>    
    <bwMon server="HOST" application="video/bwTest"/>
    <application uri="rtmp://HOST/bigbluebutton" host="http://HOST/bigbluebutton/api/enter"/>
    <language userSelectionEnabled="true" />
~~~

You will see the word `HOST` where there would be configured hostname/IP address.  You need to change the text `HOST` to the IP address (or hostname) of your BigBlueButton server.  For example, if the IP address of your BigBlueButton server is `192.168.1.145`, then using the following command you can easily substitute all occurrences of `HOST` with `192.168.1.145`.

Note: Don't copy-and-paste the following command as-is: the address `192.168.1.145` is likely not the correct IP address (or hostname) for your BigBlueButton server.  Substitute the IP address (or hostname) for your BigBlueButton server.

~~~
sed -i s/HOST/192.168.1.145/g bigbluebutton-client/src/conf/config.xml
~~~

After you've done the above command, take a quick look at the file and ensure all instances of `HOST` are properly replaced with the IP address (or hostname) of your BigBlueButton server.

The `config.xml` is ultimately loaded by the BigBlueButton client when a user joins a session on the server.  

Later on, when you deploy your modified client to the BigBlueButton server, there will be two BigBlueButton clients on your server: your modified BigBlueButton client and the default BigBlueButton packaged client (again, this is good as you can switch back and forth). However, the BigBlueButton configuration command `sudo bbb-conf ` only modifies the packaged BigBlueButton client and you will need to mirror any changes to the packaged config.xml to the secondary client's config.xml.

Next, you need to setup nginx to redirect calls to the client towards your development version. If you don't already have an nginx client development file at `/etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev`, create one with the following command.

**NOTE:** Make sure to replace "ubuntu" with your own username if it's different.

~~~
echo "
location /client/BigBlueButton.html {
	root /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
	index index.html index.htm;
	expires 1m;
}

# BigBlueButton Flash client.
location /client {
	root /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
	index index.html index.htm;
}
" | sudo tee /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev 
~~~

Check the contents to ensure it matches below.

Again, make sure you change `/home/ubuntu` to match your home directory.

~~~
$ cat /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev

location /client/BigBlueButton.html {
	root /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
	index index.html index.htm;
	expires 1m;
}

# BigBlueButton Flash client.
location /client {
	root /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
	index index.html index.htm;
}
~~~

These rules tell nginx where to find the BigBlueButton client.  Currently, nginx is using the rules with the default BigBlueButton client through a symbolic link.

~~~
$ ls -al /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 31 2013-05-05 15:44 /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx -> /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client
~~~

Modify this symbolic link so it points to the development directory for your BigBlueButton client.

~~~
sudo ln -f -s /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
~~~

Check that the modifications are in place.

~~~
$ ls -al /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 35 2013-05-05 21:07 /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx -> /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev
~~~

Now we need to restart nginx so our changes take effect.

~~~
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
$ sudo systemctl status nginx

~~~

Now, when you launch the BigBlueButton client, nginx will serve the client from your development directory.  Next, we need to rebuild the client.

## Building the client
Let's now build the client.  Note we're going to build and run the client to make sure it works before making any changes to the source.

First, we'll build the locales (language translation files).  If you are not modifying the locales, you only need to do this once.

~~~
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
ant locales
~~~

This will take about 10 minutes (depending on the speed of your computer).  Next, let's build the client

~~~
ant
~~~

This will create a build of the BigBlueButton client in the `/home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/client` directory.

**Note:** The BigBlueButton server will cache the config.xml for a given meetingID.  To ensure you load the new config.xml you must restart your BigBlueButton server after making a change to the config.xml.

The above note is important.  It's easy to make a quick change to your `config.xml` and wonder why the change is not reflected when you load the client.  You need to restart BigBlueButton using 

~~~
sudo bbb-conf --clean
~~~

After this, point your browser to your BigBlueButton server and login to the demo page.  The client should start properly.

Note: You could have also restart BigBlueButton with `sudo bbb-conf --restart`, but it's a good idea to pass `--clean` instead as it cleans out all the log files between restarts and thereby wipes any previous errors.

**Note:** On the bottom of the client you'll see "VERSION", but that's OK.  It is usually replaced by the latest build number when packaging is done.  If you see "VERSION", this is good as BigBlueButton is now loading your own copy of the client (and not the packaged version).

If you execute `sudo bbb-conf --check`, you'll notice it gives a warning

~~~
** Potential problems described below **
# Warning: nginx is not serving the client from /var/www/bigbluebutton/.
# Instead, it's being served from
#
#    /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
#
# (This is OK if you have setup a development environment.)
~~~

This is good -- it's another confirmation that the BigBlueButton server is serving your development client (not the packaged version).

## Making a change

Now that we have successfully built and loaded the client from a development environment, let's make a small visible change to the interface.  We're using `vi` to edit the client, but you can use any Unix text editor of course.

**Note:** If you are on Windows and developing using a VM, you may find it easier to setup [Samba](20dev.html#setup-samba) so you can access your files through Windows Explorer and use a Windows editor.  You can then browse the network from your Windows computer and find the shared volume.  Once mounted in Windows (usually with a drive letter such as d: or e:), you can access the files directly with your editor on Windows.


~~~
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
vi src/org/bigbluebutton/main/views/MainApplicationShell.mxml
~~~

Once you have `MainApplicationShell.mxml` open, go to line 680 and you'll see the following text

~~~mxml
<mx:Text htmlText="{ResourceUtil.getInstance().getString('bbb.mainshell.copyrightLabel2',[appVersion])}" id="copyrightLabel2"/>
~~~

Insert the text ' -- BigBlueButton Rocks!!' as shown below.

~~~mxml
<mx:Text htmlText="{ResourceUtil.getInstance().getString('bbb.mainshell.copyrightLabel2',[appVersion])} -- BigBlueButton Rocks!!!" id="copyrightLabel2"/>
~~~


Now, rebuild the BigBlueButton client again.

~~~
ant
~~~

When done, join the demo meeting using the client. You'll see the message `-- BigBlueButton Rocks!` added to the copyright line.

![rocks](/images/rocks.png)

If you don't see your changes, **try clearing your browser's cache and then load the client again**.  It also might be easier to just try this using Firefox since it most likely will not cache this.

## Switching back to the packaged client

To switch back to using the packaged BigBlueButton client anytime, you only need to change the symbolic link for nginx and then restart BigBlueButton (again, this reloads the `config.xml` file for the client).

~~~
sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
sudo bbb-conf --clean
~~~

To switch back to your development setup, simply recreate the symbolic link and restart nginx.

~~~
sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
sudo bbb-conf --clean
~~~

## Using Flex/Flash Builder

These steps assume that you have a local BigBlueButton development server on your network (or in a virtual machine).  The steps will have you install Samba on the server to give your Windows/Mac access to the file system to make code edits directly.  

Do not install samba on a BigBlueButton server on the internet.  Instead, if you want to use Flex/Flash Builder, first setup a local BigBlueButton server on your network (or in a virtual machine) and make the changes locally.  After you've updated the local BigBlueButton server, copy to modified files (and update any necessary configuration changes) to the remote BigBlueButton server.

To develop the client using Flash Builder on a local BigBlueButton server (we'll refer to the local server as the BigBlueButton VM, but it need not be a virtual machine you have for development), follow these steps:

  1. Install Flash Builder on your Windows/Mac machine.

  1. Setup samba on the BigBlueButton VM (use the command `sudo bbb-conf --setup-samba`) and mount the VM drive as described earlier in this document.

  1. In Flash Builder, import the project by going to _File_ -> _Import_ -> _Existing Projects into Workspace_.

     1. Select the _Project Folder_ radio

     1. Click _Browse_ and choose the bigbluebutton-client directory in your BigBlueButton VM. For example W:\dev\source\bigbluebutton\bigbluebutton-client

     1. Click _Finish_.

  1. From the BigBlueButton VM, copy the Flex SDK from ~/dev/tools into the Flash Builder SDK directory. You can see the location on the image below. Then, in Flash Builder, click _Window_ -> _Preferences_ -> _Installed Flex SDKs_ and _Add_ the SDK you have just copied. 

![flex-sdk](/images/flex/flex-sdk.png)

  1. Right-click on the project, go to _Properties_ -> _Flex Compiler_, and change the Flex version to 4.13. Make sure the Flash Player specific version is set to at least 11.2.0. Also, check the _Flex 3 compatibility mode_ option (The BigBlueButton client uses Flex 3 components). Click _Apply_. 

![flex-compiler](/images/flex/flex-compiler.png)

  1. Right-click on the project, click _Properties_ -> _Flex Build Path_. Click on _MX only_ component set. Make sure the libs directory is present in the _Library path_.

![flex-build-path](/images/flex/flex-build-path.png)

## Debugging with Flash Builder

  First we will set up our Flash Builder project for debugging.
	
  1. Right-click on the project, go to _Debug As_ -> _Debug Configurations...._

  1. Right-click on _Web Application_ -> _New_
  
  1. Make sure the BigBlueButton client is in the _Project_ section and src/BigBlueButton.mxml is in the _Application file_.
  
  1. Deselect _Use default_ and change the path to _about:blank_
  
  1. Select _Apply_ and _Close_
  
  Flash Builder is now set up to debug with a client running remotely (ie. on your VM). It is important to note that you must still build the client using `ant` in your VM because Flash Builder won't build the full client.

![flex-debug](/images/flex/flex-debug.png)
  
  Before you are able to debug you need to have a browser installed and the [debug version](http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html) of Flash Player Debug for it.
  
  To start debugging:
  
  1. Start a BigBlueButton session.
  
  1. In Flash Builder, open the _Debug Configurations..._, select your previously created configuration, select _Debug_
  
  1. Go back to browser and right-click the Flash content, select _Debugger_, select _Localhost_
  
  1. In Flash Builder, wait for the launch progress to get above 50%
  
  1. Go back to your broswer and select _Connect_
  
  The debugger should now be connected and you should see output in the Flash Builder Console and breakpoints will activate. An alternative to steps 3-5 is to wait for the progress to get above 50% and then reload the BigBlueButton.html page in browser. The debugger should automatically connect when the Flash content has loaded.
  
  If you can see messages in the Flash Builder Console, but breakpoints aren't working you need to make sure that the version of the client in Flash Builder is the same as the version on your server. To do this do a full build of the client with `ant` on your server and refresh the project in Flash Builder (right-click the project -> _Refesh_) before running the debugger again. Sometimes the debugger still won't work after a refresh and you have to restart Flash Builder to get it running again.

# Pulling localization from Transifex

To pull the localization from Transifex, do the following steps

1. Install the Transifex client for Ubuntu

~~~
sudo apt-get install python-pip -y
sudo pip install transifex-client
~~~

2. Go to the locale folder

~~~
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/locale 
~~~

3. Initialize the Transifex project

~~~
tx init

# Insert your transifex user and password
~~~
	
4. Set the BigBlueButton transifex resource

~~~
tx set --auto-remote https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bigbluebutton/resource/bbbresourcesproperties/
~~~

5. Edit the Transifex configuration file to filter the languages to match the BBB repository

~~~
vi .tx/config

file_filter = <lang>/bbbResources.properties 
~~~

6. Update all the languages from Transifex (updates only the languages existing in the current directory where the command is executed)

~~~
tx pull -f
~~~

    Pull all the languages from Transifex (download also languages which don't exist in the local directory where the command is executed, may download undesired language directories [lt, es_429])

~~~
tx pull -a --mode=onlytranslated
~~~

7. Sometimes Transifex downloads es_419 instead of es_LA (Latin American Spanish), in that case we need to manually update es_LA with what is in es_419

~~~
rm -r es_LA
cp es_419 es_LA
~~~

8. Add a gitignore to ignore the .tx folder or remove the .tx folder that is hidden

~~~
nano .gitignore
.tx
~~~

or

~~~
rm -r .tx
~~~

9. Compile to check you didn't break anything

~~~
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
ant locales
~~~

# Developing BBB-Client-Check

First, let's navigate to the source code for the component

~~~
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-client-check
~~~

Then modify the configurations fileto substitute your IP or domain name for the word HOST.

~~~
sed -i s/HOST/<IP or domain name>/g resources/config.xml.template
~~~

Next, let's build the component

~~~
ant
~~~

This will create a build of the bbb-client-check component in the `/home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-client-check/check` directory.

Next we need to create an nginx file to redirect calls to your development bbb-client-check.

~~~
echo "
location /check {
	root /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-client-check;
	index index.html index.htm;
}
" | sudo tee /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/check.nginx > /dev/null 2>&1
~~~

Now restart nginx and test the configuration:

~~~
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
sudo nginx -t
~~~

At this point you should be able to navigate to the check client page in your browser and use it. (e.x. http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/check)

When you make a change you will need to run `ant` again to rebuild the module.

# Developing the Red5 Applications

You need to make `red5/webapps` writeable. Otherwise, you will get a permission error when you try to deploy into Red5.

~~~
sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/share/red5/webapps
~~~

## Developing BBB-Apps

Before you build and deploy bbb-apps you need to make sure that red5 service is stopped.

~~~
sudo systemctl stop red5
~~~

First we have to compile bbb-apps-common

~~~
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-apps-common
sbt clean
sbt publish publishLocal
~~~

Now you can compile and deploy bigbluebutton-apps.

~~~
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-apps
./deploy.sh
~~~

And finally, you can start the red5 service up again.

~~~
sudo systemctl start red5
~~~

## Developing BBB-Video

First, you need to stop red5.

~~~
sudo systemctl stop red5
~~~

Then you can compile and deploy the application.

~~~
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-video
gradle resolveDeps
gradle war deploy
~~~

And finally, start red5 up again.

~~~
sudo systemctl start red5 
~~~

## Developing BBB-Voice

First, you need to stop red5.

~~~
sudo systemctl stop bbb-red5 
~~~

Then you can compile and deploy the application.

~~~
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-voice
gradle resolveDeps
gradle war deploy
~~~

And finally, start red5 up again.

~~~
sudo systemctl start bbb-red5 
~~~

## Developing Screen Sharing

See the the [README](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/tree/master/bbb-screenshare) file in the `bbb-screenshare` directory for details on how to compile and sign the Screen Sharing applet.

# Troubleshooting

## Connecting to the server
When the BigBlueButton client loads, it runs a number of modules: chat, voice, desktop sharing, and presentation.  Each of these modules makes a connection back to their corresponding BigBlueButton server components.

The URL for each connection is specified in [config.xml](/install/configuration-files.html#modules).

When setting up a development environment for the client, the `config.xml` file for the BigBlueButton client is now loaded from `~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/client/conf/config.xml`.  This means that any changes made to the default `config.xml` by `sudo bbb-conf --setip <hostname>` will _not_ affect the `config.xml` in your development environment.  Thus, if you change your hostname or IP address for the BigBlueButton server, you'll need to manually change the `config.xml` for your development environment.

## Old Translation
If you get a "Old Translation" warning when starting the client, in `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config.xml` change

~~~xml
<localeversion suppressWarning="false">0.71</localeversion>
~~~

to

~~~xml
<localeversion suppressWarning="false">0.9.0</localeversion>
~~~

## Warning: Try increasing the code cache size

If you get a compiler warning during the building of bbb-client, such as

~~~
build-polling:
    [mxmlc] Loading configuration file /home/dwelch/dev/tools/flex-4.5.0.20967/frameworks/flex-config.xml
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: CodeCache is full. Compiler has been disabled.
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Try increasing the code cache size using -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=
    [mxmlc] /home/dwelch/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/client/PollingModule.swf (232039 bytes)
~~~

Add the following to `~/.profile`

~~~
export ANT_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=1024m"
~~~

and then reload the .profile with the command `source ~/.profile`.
