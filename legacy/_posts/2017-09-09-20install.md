# BigBlueButton 2.0-beta

BigBlueButton 2.0-beta (referred hereafter as BigBlueButton 2.0) it a significant upgrade to BigBlueButton 1.1. BigBlueButton 2.0 adds an improved user interface, shared notes, and multi-user whiteboard -- all to enable the instructor to increase engagement with students.  For more details see [what's new in BigBlueButton 2.0](/2.0/20overview.html).

You can [upgrade directly from a BigBlueButton 1.1 server](#upgrade-from-bigbluebutton-11-to-20-beta), or install BigBlueButton 2.0 on a new server via two options:

  * [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) - Install BigBlueButton 2.0 with a single command (recommended).
  * [Step-by-step install](#step-by-step-install) - The complete install guide for setting up BigBlueButton 2.0.

## Step-by-step install

To install BigBlueButton 2.0, follow the steps in [BigBlueButton 1.1 Install Guide](/install/install.html) with _one_ difference: when you reach [Step 2. Install apt-get key for BigBlueButton repositoryAnchor](/install/install.html#install-apt-get-key-for-bigbluebutton-repository), change the command from

~~~
echo "deb https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/xenial-110/ bigbluebutton-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
~~~

to

~~~
echo "deb https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/xenial-200/ bigbluebutton-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
~~~

Notice the repository URL has changed from `xenial-110` to `xenial-200`.

You will also want a newer version of `ffmpeg`:

~~~
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/ffmpeg-4
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo bbb-conf --restart
~~~

That's it.  Proceed through the rest of the installation steps and you'll have a BigBlueButton 2.0 running at the end.  

After the install, you can see that most of the packages are now 2.0 by running `dpkg -l | grep bbb`.  Here's a sample output on one of our test servers (your versions may be slightly ahead).

We regularly post updates to BigBlueButton 2.0 in the [bigbluebutton developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-dev).  The section [Upgrade to the latest build of BigBlueButton 2.0](#upgrade-to-latest-build-of-bigbluebuttton-20) shows how.


### Upgrade from BigBlueButton 1.1 to 2.0-beta

To upgrade your BigBlueButton server from 1.1 to 2.0, login to the server via SSH and edit the file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list`.  Change the line in this file so it reads

~~~
deb https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/xenial-200/ bigbluebutton-xenial main
~~~


You will also want a newer version of `ffmpeg`:

~~~
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/ffmpeg-4
~~~

Notice the repository URL has changed from `xenial-110` to `xenial-200`.

You need only do the above steps once on a server, next enter the following commands

~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
~~~

Notice the repository URL has changed from `xenial-110` to `xenial-200`.  You need only do the above step once on a server.  

Next, to ensure that all the BigBlueButton configuration files are properly updated with the correct hostname/IP address of your server, enter the following commands and substitute `<IP_or_hostname>` with the IP address or hostname of your BigBlueButton server (use whichever the server had previously been configured for).

~~~
sudo bbb-conf --setip <IP_or_hostname>
sudo bbb-conf --check
~~~

### Upgrade to latest build of BigBlueButton 2.0-beta

These steps assume you have already upgraded from 1.1 to 2.0-beta and want to upgrade to a later build of 2.0-beta.

As part of BigBlueButton 2.0 you would want to have `ffmpeg` version 4.x. If the result of the command `ffmpeg -v` is not 4.x, add the repository for the correct version via:

~~~
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/ffmpeg-4
~~~

Now you can proceed with updating BigBlueButton.

To install the latest build of BigBlueButton 2.0-beta, enter the following commands:

~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
~~~

To ensure that all the BigBlueButton configuration files are properly updated with the correct hostname/IP address of your server, enter the following commands and substitute `<IP_or_hostname>` with the IP address or hostname of your BigBlueButton server (use whichever the server had previously been configured for).

~~~
sudo bbb-conf --setip <IP_or_hostname>
sudo bbb-conf --check
~~~

If you encounter any issues during installation/upgrade, please post to our [bigbluebutton-setup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-setup) mailing list with a description of the issue you encountered.

## Install the HTML5 client (after upgrade to 2.0)

If you want to install the HTML5 client on your upgraded 2.0-beta server, see [Install HTML5](/html/html5-install.html).

## Troubleshooting

### Packages to be removed

If you had previously installed the HTML5 packages on a an earlier build of 2.0-beta, you might see this message

~~~
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  bbb-html5 bbb-webrtc-sfu kms-core-6.0 kms-elements-6.0 kms-filters-6.0 kurento-media-server-6.0
~~~

If so, enter 'Y' to continue.  After the upgrade runs, you can run `sudo apt-get install bbb-html5` to install the new HTML5 packages.

~~~
sudo apt-get install bbb-html5
~~~

and then remove the older packages:

~~~
sudo apt-get purge kms-core-6.0 kms-elements-6.0 kurento-media-server-6.0
~~~

Also, check the contents of `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/config/default.yml` for the entry for `kurentoUrl` (it is near the top).  If `kurentoUrl` has a `wss` in it, as in

~~~
  kurentoUrl: wss://<server_name>/kurento
~~~

then change it to the format

~~~
  kurentoUrl: ws://<server_name>:8888/kurento
~~~
