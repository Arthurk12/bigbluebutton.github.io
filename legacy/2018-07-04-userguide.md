This is going to go quickly.  Hang on while we walk through the steps.

## Basics

### Audio 

When you startup BigBlueButton it first asks you how you want to join the audio: microphone or listen only.

We recommend using FireFox or Chome as you'll get to join with the built-in capabilities of the browser.  After you join you'll see the phone icon highlight with a microphone icon to mute/unmute yourself.

When you talk, the microphone icon highlights to show your generating audio.  You'll also see the microphone icon next to your name in the Users list.

You can leave the audio channel at any time by clicking the red phone icon to hang up (and later click it again to rejoin).

### Chat

The chat window lets you interact with others.

You can also private chat with others by clicking the Options tab and then selecting a user name from the list.

When you start a private chat, you'll be in a new tab with the user's name.

Any messages typed in this tab are only visible to the other user in the private chat.

### Webcam

You can share your webcam with others by selecting the camera icon at the top.

When selected, you'll see a dialog appear giving you a preview of your video.  You usually be asked to give permission to share your video.  Click the 'Allow' button.
