# BigBlueButton runs within Docker

This document describes how to run a BigBlueButton 2.0 server inside a docker container.   Running BigBlueButton inside of Docker makes it easy for anyone to try BigBlueButton on their computer (instead of getting a remote server).  

** Note: ** We are working on support for running BigBlueButton 2.2-beta inside of docker.

If you have an external server that meets the following [minimal requirements](/install/install.html#minimum-server-requirements), you can install BigBlueButton following the [step-by-step instructions](/install/install.html) or with a single command using [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install).

However, if you have a computer (such as Mac OS X) that runs Docker, you can obtain the IP address of your computer (using `ifconfig`) and then run BigBlueButton server with a single command.

```bash
$ docker run -p 80:80/tcp -p 443:443/tcp -p 1935:1935 -p 5066:5066 -p 3478:3478 -p 3478:3478/udp bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton -h IP_ADDRESS
```

We were not trying to create a production version of BigBlueButton that runs under docker.  If you look at the Docker file for BigBlueButton, you'll see it runs everything within a single container.  This is clearly not the "docker way".

Still, for anyone curious to try out BigBlueButton on a operating system capable of running Docker you now run your own BigBlueButton server with a single `docker run` command.  Maybe your a WordPress developer or Moodle developer and want to try out BigBlueButton with your site, or maybe your a developer wanting to understand how BigBlueButton works.  Now you can run a server locally, SSH into it, see how it works, make changes (and maybe even break a few things to understand more), and then wipe the slate clean and start again. Cool.

Another goal of creating a Docker container for BigBlueButton was to explore how far we could go without requiring any elevated previliges to run.  In other words, we wanted BigBlueButton running within docker to be isolated from the host computer and minimized resource conflicts.

As a result, running BigBlueButton in Docker has the following limitations:

* Nginx does not have a SSL certificate, so you'll need to use FireFox to use WebRTC audio/video
* Processes are started using `supervisord` (instead of `systemd`)
* The HTML5 client supports video but not desktop sharing using WebRTC

You can find the lateset Docker image on Docker hub at [bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton](https://hub.docker.com/r/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/)

# Getting Started

You need to install Docker on your computer.  The docker site has very good [instructions for installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

# Running BigBlueButton in Docker

You have two options for running BigBlueButton in Docker. You can either pull the image from Docker hub or build the Docker image from source.

## Build the Docker Image

If you want to build the Docker image yourself from source, do the following steps; otherwise, skip to the next section.

You will need to clone the source from Github. You can find the repository on Github at [bigbluebutton/docker](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/docker).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bigbluebutton/docker
```

If you have a local `apt-get` caching server (such as using `apt-cacher-ng`), then edit the Docker file, uncomment the following line and change 192.168.0.130 to match the hostname/IP address of your proxy server.

```
# RUN echo 'Acquire::http::Proxy "http://192.168.0.130:3142";'  > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy
```

Doing this will speed up repeated builds of the Docker container.

To build the docker image, enter the directory and run the following `docker build` command:

```bash
$ cd docker
$ docker build -t bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton .
```

After Docker has finished building the BigBlueButton image, you can check it using the `docker images` command.

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                TAG      IMAGE ID         CREATED             SIZE
bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton      latest   ca5ab0317d11     18 hours ago        3.11 GB
```

## Run BigBlueButton in Docker

BigBlueButton needs to know the IP address of the host running the container so it can listen for incoming connections.  However, Docker does not make the host's IP address available to applications running within inside a docker container.  Therefore, to run BigBlueButton witin a Docker container, you need to pass the IP address of your computer via the parameter `-h <HOSTIP>`.  Here we are running BigBlueButton on the host with IP address `192.168.0.130`.

```bash
$ docker run -p 80:80/tcp -p 1935:1935 -p 5066:5066 -p 3478:3478 -p 3478:3478/udp --name bigbluebutton bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton -h 192.168.0.130
```

If you didn't already build the image, it will take a few minutes to pull the image from Docker Hub.   Once the docker container is running, takes a few more seconds for BigBlueButton to startup.  Once started, you can login with FireFox using `http://<HOSTIP>` and launch BigBlueButton.

![Install](/images/docker.png)

The Docker image has the package `bbb-demo` already installed so all the API demos are available.  You can access the HTML5 client with the `http://<HOSTIP>/demo/demoHTML5.jsp`.  Here's the HTML5 client running within the docker container.

# Under the hood

The installation of BigBlueButton occurs using the standard BigBlueButton packages.  You can see this in the Dockerfile at the step

```docker
RUN apt-get install -y bigbluebutton
```

However, Docker is designed to run a single process.  Normally, BigBlueButton would use `systemd` to start/stop all the processes.  However, Docker does not support `systemd`.  We took inspiration from [this project](https://github.com/harvard-dce/canvas-docker) that runs Canvas LMS inside using `supervisorctl` to start the processes.

The end of the Docker file for BigBlueButton runs a script `startup.sh`

```docker
ADD setup.sh /root/setup.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/root/setup.sh"]
CMD []
```

which receives the parameter `-h IP` for the IP address of your computer.  It then updates all the BigBlueButton configuration files to use that `IP` address, and at the end runs `supervisorctl` to start the individual BigBlueButton components.

```bash
$ exec /usr/bin/supervisord > /var/log/supervisord.log
```

When `supervisorctl` runs, it uses the [supervisord.conf](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/docker/blob/master/supervisord.conf) file to run each of the processes

* bbb-apps-akka
* bbb-fsesl-akka
* bbb-html5
* bbb-webrtc-sfu
* coturn
* freeswitch
* kurento-media-server
* mongod
* nginx
* rap-archive-worker
* rap-process-worker
* rap-publish-worker
* rap-sanity-worker
* red5
* redis-server
* tomcat7

Both FreeSWITCH and Kurento (installed by `bbb-webrtc-sfu`) are listening to the internal IP address of the Docker container.  The TURN server `coturn`  proxies all the external request for web socket connections to FreeSWITCH and Kurento through port 3478.  The Record and Playback (rap) workers get run every 20 seconds by `supervisorctl`.  

# Administration

## Login to the container

If the container is running, you can login using the command

```bash
$ docker exec -it bigbluebutton /bin/bash
root@4dd41ad9bba0:/#
```

Yay, we now have a full BigBlueButton server at our command.  Let's see what `bbb-conf --check` says.

```

Here you can see the internal IP address of the docker container is 172.17.0.2 does not match the external IP address of the host is 192.168.0.130.  This is more of a warning as the `setup.sh` script has already configured BigBlueButton with an internal/external IP address according to the steps to [configure BigBlueButton behind a firewall](/install/install.html#configuring-bigbluebutton-behind-a-firewall).

## Restart BigBlueButton

As stated ealier, the Ubuntu 16.04 image for Docker does not provide `systemd` but instead uses [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/).

To see the status of all the processes, login to the Docker container (see previous section) and enter the command
`supervisorctl status`.

```bash
$ supervisorctl status
bbb-apps-akka                    RUNNING   pid 145, uptime 0:05:38
bbb-fsesl-akka                   RUNNING   pid 139, uptime 0:05:38
bbb-html5                        RUNNING   pid 162, uptime 0:05:38
bbb-webrtc-sfu                   RUNNING   pid 158, uptime 0:05:38
coturn                           RUNNING   pid 165, uptime 0:05:38
freeswitch                       RUNNING   pid 148, uptime 0:05:38
kurento-media-server             RUNNING   pid 146, uptime 0:05:38
mongod                           RUNNING   pid 478, uptime 0:05:37
nginx                            RUNNING   pid 143, uptime 0:05:38
rap-archive-worker               RUNNING   pid 1716, uptime 0:00:04
rap-process-worker               RUNNING   pid 1718, uptime 0:00:03
rap-publish-worker               STARTING
rap-sanity-worker                RUNNING   pid 1720, uptime 0:00:01
red5                             RUNNING   pid 136, uptime 0:05:38
redis-server                     EXITED    Aug 31 02:59 PM
tomcat7                          RUNNING   pid 138, uptime 0:05:38
```

You may see record and playback scripts showing `EXITED.  This is the expected behaviour as they automatically quit after 20 seconds if there is no recording to process) and  `supervisord` will simply run them again.

You can restart BigBlueButton using the command `supervisorctl restart all`

```bash
$ supervisorctl restart all
rap-archive-worker: stopped
rap-publish-worker: stopped
bbb-html5: stopped
coturn: stopped
rap-process-worker: stopped
rap-sanity-worker: stopped
nginx: stopped
kurento-media-server: stopped
bbb-webrtc-sfu: stopped
mongod: stopped
bbb-apps-akka: stopped
bbb-fsesl-akka: stopped
red5: stopped
tomcat7: stopped
freeswitch: stopped
red5: started
tomcat7: started
bbb-fsesl-akka: started
nginx: started
bbb-apps-akka: started
freeswitch: started
redis-server: started
coturn: started
mongod: ERROR (spawn error)
rap-archive-worker: started
rap-process-worker: started
rap-sanity-worker: started
rap-publish-worker: started
kurento-media-server: started
bbb-webrtc-sfu: started
bbb-html5: started
```

Again, you can ignore the `(spawn error)` for the record and playback scripts as they exit if there is not recording to process.

### Stopping to docker container

When you are finished with running BigBlueButton in docker, get the name of the container with `docker ps`.  For example, if this command returns the name of the container as `vibrant_shockley`, then you can stop the container with the command

```bash
$ docker stop bigbluebutton
```

## Troubleshooting

### Windows 10 Pro automatically binds to port 80

We not yet figured out how to run BigBlueButton on Windows 10 pro as Windows seems to already have an application binding to port 80.
