Welcome to the BigBlueButton Developer's Guide for BigBlueButton 2.0.

This document gives you an overview of how to setup a development environment for BigBlueButton 2.0.

# Before you begin

You first need to setup a BigBlueButton 2.0 server.  See the instructions at [Install BigBlueButton 2.0](/2.0/20install.html).

# Overview

A BigBlueButton server is built from a number of components that correspond to Ubuntu packages.  Some of these components are

* bbb-web -- Implements the BigBlueButton API and conversion of documents for presentation
* bbb-client -- Flash based client that loads within the browser
* bbb-apps -- Server side application for sending and receiving messages with the Flash client
* akka-bbb-apps -- Server side application that handles the state of meetings on the server
* bbb-screenshare -- Screen sharing server

You don't need to understand everything about each component, but you do need to understand the [overall architecture](/overview/architecture.html) and how the components work together.

This document describes how to setup a development environment using an existing BigBlueButton 2.0 server.  Once the environment is setup, you will be able to make custom changes to BigBlueButton source, compile the source, and replace the corresponding components on the server (such as updating the BigBlueButton client).

The instructions in this guide are step-by-step so you can understand each step needed to modify a component.  If you encounter problems or errors at any section, don't ignore the errors.  Stop and double-check that you have done the step correctly.  If you are unable to determine the cause of the error, do the following

* First, use Google to search for the error.  There is a wealth of information in [bigbluebutton-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/bigbluebutton-dev) that has been indexed by Google.
* Try doing the same steps on a different BigBlueButton server.
* Post a question to bigbluebutton-dev with a description of the problem and the steps to reproduce. Post logs and error messages to [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com) link them in your post.

## Before you begin

This section makes sure you are ready to setup a BigBlueButton development environment.

### You Have a Working BigBlueButton Server

Before you can start developing on BigBlueButton, you must install BigBlueButton 2.0 (see [installation steps](/2.0/20install.html)) and ensure it's working correctly. Make sure there were no errors during the installation and that you can join a session successfully.

We emphasize that your BigBlueButton server must be working **before** you start setting up the development environment.  Be sure that you can login, start sessions, join the audio bridge, share your webcam, and record and playback sessions -- all using the built-in API demos.

By starting with a working BigBlueButton server, you have the ability to switch back-and-forth between the default-packaged components and any modifications you make.

For example, suppose you modify the BigBlueButton client and something isn't working (such as the client is not fully loading), you can easily switch back to the default-packaged client and check that it's working correctly (thus ruling out any environment issues that may also be preventing your modified client from loading).

**Another Note:** These instructions assume you have the `bbb-demo` package installed so you can run any of the API demos to test your setup.

### Developing on Windows

To develop BigBlueButton from within Windows, use VMWare Player or VirtualBox to create first an Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit virtual machine (VM).  The associated documentation for VMWare Player and VirtualBox will guide you on setting up a new 16.04 64-bit VM.

When setting up the VM, it does not matter to BigBlueButton if you setup Ubuntu 16.04 server or desktop.  If you install desktop, you'll have the option of using a graphical interface to edit files.  When running the VM, you will need a host operating system capable of running a [64-bit virtual machine](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/56124/can-i-run-a-64-bit-vmware-image-on-a-32-bit-machine).

### Root Privileges

**Important:** Make sure you create another user such as "ubuntu" to avoid running into permission errors such as Nginx 403 Forbidden error or [error-null-while-compiling-resource-bundles-under-linux-with-hudson](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3863066/error-null-while-compiling-resource-bundles-under-linux-with-hudson).

Do not run commands as the root user and only use sudo when instructed to.

These instructions are written for an account called "ubuntu", but they will apply to any account that has the permissions to execute commands as root, such as

```bash
$ sudo ls
```

### wget

You'll need to download some files throughout these instructions using wget. If it's not installed on your server, you can install the package using the following command

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install wget
```

### Have a GitHub Account

The BigBlueButton [source is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton).  You need a GitHub account.  In addition, you need to be very familiar with how git works.  Specifically, you need to know how to

* clone a repository
* create a branch
* push changes back to a repository

If you have not used git before, or if the terms **_clone_**, **_branch_**, and **_commit_** are unfamiliar to you, stop now.  These are fundamental concepts to git that you need to become competent with before trying to develop on BigBlueButton. To become competent, a good place to start is this [free book](http://progit.org/book/) and [GitHub Help pages](http://help.github.com/).

Using GitHub makes it easy for you to work on your own copy of the BigBlueButton source, store your updates to the source to your GitHub account, and make it easy for you to [contribute to BigBlueButton](/support/faq.html#contributing-to-bigbluebutton).

### Subscribe to bigbluebutton-dev

We recommend you subscribe to the [bigbluebutton-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2) mailing list to follow updates to the development of BigBlueButton and to collaborate with other developers.

# Setup a Development Environment

First, you need to install the core development tools.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install git-core ant openjdk-8-jdk-headless
```

With the JDK installed, you need to set the JAVA_HOME variable. Edit `~/.profile` (here we are using vim to edit the file)

```bash
$ vi ~/.profile
```

Add the following line at the end of the file

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
```

Reload your profile (this will happen automatically when you next login, but we'll do it explicitly here to load the new environment variable).

```bash
$ source ~/.profile
```

Do a quick test to ensure JAVA_HOME is set.

```bash
$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
```

In the next step, you need to install a number of tools using sdkman.

```bash
$ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
$ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
$ sdk install gradle 2.12
$ sdk install grails 2.5.2
$ sdk install sbt 0.13.9
$ sdk install maven 3.5.0
```

Next, you need to make a directory to hold the tools needed for BigBlueButton development.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/dev/tools
$ cd ~/dev/tools
```

In the next step, you need to get the Apache Flex 4.13.0 SDK package. 

First, you need to download the SDK tarball from an Apache mirror site and then unpack it.

```bash
$ wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/flex/4.13.0/binaries/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin.tar.gz
```

Once the Apache Flex SDK is unpacked, you need to download one of the dependencies manually because the file was moved from its original URL.

```bash
$ wget --content-disposition https://github.com/swfobject/swfobject/archive/2.2.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz swfobject-2.2.tar.gz
$ cp -r swfobject-2.2/swfobject apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/templates/
```

Now that we've finished with the first dependency we need to download the Adobe Flex SDK.  We'll do this step manually in case the download fails (if it does, remove the incomplete file and issue the `wget` command again).

```bash
$ cd apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/
$ mkdir -p in/
$ wget http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flex/sdk/builds/flex4.6/flex_sdk_4.6.0.23201B.zip -P in/
```

Once the supplementary SDK has downloaded, we can use its `build.xml` script to automatically download the remaining third-party tools.

```bash
$ ant -f frameworks/build.xml thirdparty-downloads
```

After Flex downloads the remaining third-party tools, you need to modify their permissions.

```bash
$ find ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin -type d -exec chmod o+rx '{}' \;
$ chmod 755 ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/bin/*
$ chmod -R +r ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin
```

Next, create a linked directory with a shortened name for easier referencing.

```
$ ln -s ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin ~/dev/tools/flex
```

The next step in setting up the Flex SDK environment is to download a Flex library for video.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/frameworks/libs/player/11.2
$ cd ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin/frameworks/libs/player/11.2
$ wget http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/installers/archive/playerglobal/playerglobal11_2.swc
$ mv -f playerglobal11_2.swc playerglobal.swc
```

The last step to have a working Flex SDK is to configure it to work with playerglobal 11.2

```bash
$ cd ~/dev/tools/apache-flex-sdk-4.13.0-bin
$ sed -i "s/11.1/11.2/g" frameworks/flex-config.xml
$ sed -i "s/<swf-version>14<\/swf-version>/<swf-version>15<\/swf-version>/g" frameworks/flex-config.xml
$ sed -i "s/{playerglobalHome}\/{targetPlayerMajorVersion}.{targetPlayerMinorVersion}/libs\/player\/11.2/g" frameworks/flex-config.xml
```

With the tools installed, you need to add a set of environment variables to your `.profile` to access these tools.

```bash
$ vi ~/.profile
```

Copy-and-paste the following text at bottom of `.profile`.

```
export FLEX_HOME=$HOME/dev/tools/flex
export PATH=$PATH:$FLEX_HOME/bin

export ANT_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"
```

Reload your profile to use these tools (this will happen automatically when you next login).

```bash
source ~/.profile
```

Check that the tools are now in your path by running the following command.

```bash
$ mxmlc -version
Version 4.13.0 build 20140701
```

## Checking out the Source

With the development tools installed, we'll next clone the source in the following directory:

```
/home/ubuntu/dev
```

Using your GitHub account, do the following

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the BigBlueButton repository into your GitHub account
2. Clone your repository into your `~/dev` folder

After cloning, you'll have the following directory (make sure the `bigbluebutton` directory is within your `dev` directory).

```
/home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton
```

Confirm that you are working on the master branch.

```bash
$ cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton
$ git status
```

You should see

```
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

When you first clone the BigBlueButton git repository, git will place you, by default, on the `master` branch, which is the latest code for BigBlueButton.  The release branch for 2.0 is on the `v2.0.x-release` branch.

The first thing we need to do is to add the remote repository to our local clone.

```bash
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton.git
```

You can now check your local list of tracked repositories to verify that the addition worked. You should see at least two results (origin and upstream). The one named "origin" should link to your personal fork and is the repository that you cloned. The second result "upstream" should link to the main BigBlueButton repository.

```bash
$ git remote -v
```

After, we need to fetch the most up to date version of the remote repository.

```bash
$ git fetch upstream
```

You are now ready to create a new branch to start your work and base the new branch off v2.0.x-release.

```bash
$ git checkout -b my-changes-branch upstream/v2.0.x-release
```

"checkout" switches branches

"-b" is an option to create a new branch before switching

"my-changes-branch" will be the name of the new branch

"upstream/v2.0.x-release" is where you want to start your new branch

You should now confirm that you are in the correct branch.

```bash
$ git status

# On branch my-changes-branch
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

# Production Environment

Okay. Let's pause for a minute. 

You have set-up the necessary tools and cloned the source, but if you are going to start making changes to BigBlueButton code you need to understand how the parts interact. 

Below is an overview of the different components in a production set-up. When developing you want to change your configuration settings to load new changes instead of the ones deployed for production.

![production](/images/10/prod-env.png)

As you can see, nginx is configured to load the client from `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client` directory and forward calls to web-api on tomcat7. During development, you need to tell nginx to load from your development directory (`/home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton`)

After going through the steps below, you will end up with the following setup.

![development](/images/10/dev-env.png)

The components that run in Red5 don't change when you deploy the development files for bbb-apps, bbb-voice, bbb-video, and bbb-deskshare into `/usr/share/red5`. However, notice that the client and web-api are served from  different places.

# Client Development

With the development environment checked out and the code cloned, we are ready to start developing!

This section will walk you through making a simple change to the BigBlueButton client.

## Setting up the environment

The first thing you need to do is to copy the template `config.xml` file to the build directory for the client.

```bash
$ cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/
$ cp bigbluebutton-client/resources/config.xml.template bigbluebutton-client/src/conf/config.xml
```

The `config.xml` file is one of the first files loaded by the BigBlueButton client when it connects to the server.  The `config.xml` file tells BigBlueButton client how to load the remaining components (such as chat module, deskshare module, video conf module, etc.) and sets a number of configuration parameters for each component.  The `config.xml` specifies the hostname (or IP address) for loading each component.

Let's look at the first ten lines of the `config.xml` file you just copied.

```
$ head -n 10 bigbluebutton-client/src/conf/config.xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<config>
    <localeversion suppressWarning="false">0.9.0</localeversion>
    <version>VERSION</version>
    <help url="http://HOST/help.html"/>
    <javaTest url="http://HOST/testjava.html"/>
    <porttest host="HOST" application="video/portTest" timeout="10000"/>    
    <bwMon server="HOST" application="video/bwTest"/>
    <application uri="rtmp://HOST/bigbluebutton" host="http://HOST/bigbluebutton/api/enter"/>
    <language userSelectionEnabled="true" />
```

You will see the word `HOST` where there would be configured hostname/IP address.  You need to change the text `HOST` to the IP address (or hostname) of your BigBlueButton server.  For example, if the IP address of your BigBlueButton server is `192.168.1.145`, then using the following command you can easily substitute all occurrences of `HOST` with `192.168.1.145`.

Note: Don't copy-and-paste the following command as-is: the address `192.168.1.145` is likely not the correct IP address (or hostname) for your BigBlueButton server.  Substitute the IP address (or hostname) for your BigBlueButton server.

```bash
$ sed -i s/HOST/192.168.1.145/g bigbluebutton-client/src/conf/config.xml
```

After you've done the above command, take a quick look at the file and ensure all instances of `HOST` are properly replaced with the IP address (or hostname) of your BigBlueButton server.

The `config.xml` is ultimately loaded by the BigBlueButton client when a user joins a session on the server.  

Later on, when you deploy your modified client to the BigBlueButton server, there will be two BigBlueButton clients on your server: your modified BigBlueButton client and the default BigBlueButton packaged client (again, this is good as you can switch back and forth). However, the BigBlueButton configuration command `sudo bbb-conf ` only modifies the packaged BigBlueButton client and you will need to mirror any changes to the packaged config.xml to the secondary client's config.xml.

Next, you need to setup nginx to redirect calls to the client towards your development version. If you don't already have an nginx client development file at `/etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev`, create one with the following command.

**NOTE:** Make sure to replace "ubuntu" with your own username if it's different.

```bash
$ echo "
location /client/BigBlueButton.html {
    root /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
    index index.html index.htm;
    expires 1m;
}

# BigBlueButton Flash client.
location /client {
    root /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
    index index.html index.htm;
}
" | sudo tee /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev 
```

Check the contents to ensure it matches below.

Again, make sure you change `/home/ubuntu` to match your home directory.

```bash
$ cat /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev

location /client/BigBlueButton.html {
    root /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
    index index.html index.htm;
    expires 1m;
}

# BigBlueButton Flash client.
location /client {
    root /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client;
    index index.html index.htm;
}
```

These rules tell nginx where to find the BigBlueButton client.  Currently, nginx is using the rules with the default BigBlueButton client through a symbolic link.

```bash
$ ls -al /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 31 2013-05-05 15:44 /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx -> /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client
```

Modify this symbolic link so it points to the development directory for your BigBlueButton client.

```bash
$ sudo ln -f -s /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
```

Check that the modifications are in place.

```bash
$ ls -al /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 35 2013-05-05 21:07 /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx -> /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev
```

Now we need to restart nginx so our changes take effect.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
$ sudo systemctl status nginx

Jan 15 22:43:31 t4 systemd[1]: Started A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server.
```

Now, when you launch the BigBlueButton client, nginx will serve the client from your development directory.  Next, we need to rebuild the client.

## Building the client

Let's now build the client.  Note we're going to build and run the client to make sure it works before making any changes to the source.

First, we'll build the locales (language translation files).  If you are not modifying the locales, you only need to do this once.

```bash
$ cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
$ ant locales
```

This will take about 10 minutes (depending on the speed of your computer).  Next, let's build the client

```bash
$ ant
```

This will create a build of the BigBlueButton client in the `/home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/client` directory.

**Note:** The BigBlueButton server will cache the config.xml for a given meetingID.  To ensure you load the new config.xml you must restart your BigBlueButton server after making a change to the config.xml.

The above note is important.  It's easy to make a quick change to your `config.xml` and wonder why the change is not reflected when you load the client.  You need to restart BigBlueButton using 

```bash
$ sudo bbb-conf --clean
```

After this, point your browser to your BigBlueButton server and login to the demo page.  The client should start properly.

Note: You could have also restart BigBlueButton with `sudo bbb-conf --restart`, but it's a good idea to pass `--clean` instead as it cleans out all the log files between restarts and thereby wipes any previous errors.

**Note:** On the bottom of the client you'll see "VERSION", but that's OK.  It is usually replaced by the latest build number when packaging is done.  If you see "VERSION", this is good as BigBlueButton is now loading your own copy of the client (and not the packaged version).

If you execute `sudo bbb-conf --check`, you'll notice it gives a warning

```
** Potential problems described below **
# Warning: nginx is not serving the client from /var/www/bigbluebutton/.
# Instead, it's being served from
#
#    /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
#
# (This is OK if you have setup a development environment.)
```

This is good -- it's another confirmation that the BigBlueButton server is serving your development client (not the packaged version).

## Making a change

Now that we have successfully built and loaded the client from a development environment, let's make a small visible change to the interface.  We're using `vi` to edit the client, but you can use any Unix text editor of course.

**Note:** If you are on Windows and developing using a VM, you may find it easier to setup [Samba](20dev.html#setup-samba) so you can access your files through Windows Explorer and use a Windows editor.  You can then browse the network from your Windows computer and find the shared volume.  Once mounted in Windows (usually with a drive letter such as d: or e:), you can access the files directly with your editor on Windows.

```bash
$ cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
$ vi src/org/bigbluebutton/main/views/MainApplicationShell.mxml
```

Once you have `MainApplicationShell.mxml` open, go to line 680 and you'll see the following text

```actionscript
<mx:Text htmlText="{ResourceUtil.getInstance().getString('bbb.mainshell.copyrightLabel2',[appVersion])}" id="copyrightLabel2"/>
```

Insert the text ' -- BigBlueButton Rocks!!' as shown below.

```mxml
<mx:Text htmlText="{ResourceUtil.getInstance().getString('bbb.mainshell.copyrightLabel2',[appVersion])} -- BigBlueButton Rocks!!!" id="copyrightLabel2"/>
```

Now, rebuild the BigBlueButton client again.

```bash
$ ant
```

When done, join the demo meeting using the client. You'll see the message `-- BigBlueButton Rocks!` added to the copyright line.

![rocks](/images/rocks.png)

If you don't see your changes, **try clearing your browser's cache and then load the client again**.  It also might be easier to just try this using Firefox since it most likely will not cache this.

## Switching back to the packaged client

To switch back to using the packaged BigBlueButton client anytime, you only need to change the symbolic link for nginx and then restart BigBlueButton (again, this reloads the `config.xml` file for the client).

```bash
$ sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
$ sudo bbb-conf --clean
```

To switch back to your development setup, simply recreate the symbolic link and restart nginx.

```bash
$ sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client_dev /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client.nginx
$ sudo bbb-conf --clean
```

## Using Flex/Flash Builder

These steps assume that you have a local BigBlueButton development server on your network (or in a virtual machine).  The steps will have you install Samba on the server to give your Windows/Mac access to the file system to make code edits directly.  

Do not install samba on a BigBlueButton server on the internet.  Instead, if you want to use Flex/Flash Builder, first setup a local BigBlueButton server on your network (or in a virtual machine) and make the changes locally.  After you've updated the local BigBlueButton server, copy to modified files (and update any necessary configuration changes) to the remote BigBlueButton server.

To develop the client using Flash Builder on a local BigBlueButton server (we'll refer to the local server as the BigBlueButton VM, but it need not be a virtual machine you have for development), follow these steps:

1. Install Flash Builder on your Windows/Mac machine.

2. Setup samba on the BigBlueButton VM (use the command `sudo bbb-conf --setup-samba`) and mount the VM drive as described earlier in this document.

3. In Flash Builder, import the project by going to _File_ -> _Import_ -> _Existing Projects into Workspace_.
   
   1. Select the _Project Folder_ radio
   
   2. Click _Browse_ and choose the bigbluebutton-client directory in your BigBlueButton VM. For example W:\dev\source\bigbluebutton\bigbluebutton-client
   
   3. Click _Finish_.

4. From the BigBlueButton VM, copy the Flex SDK from ~/dev/tools into the Flash Builder SDK directory. You can see the location on the image below. Then, in Flash Builder, click _Window_ -> _Preferences_ -> _Installed Flex SDKs_ and _Add_ the SDK you have just copied. 

![flex-sdk](/images/flex/flex-sdk.png)

1. Right-click on the project, go to _Properties_ -> _Flex Compiler_, and change the Flex version to 4.13. Make sure the Flash Player specific version is set to at least 11.2.0. Also, check the _Flex 3 compatibility mode_ option (The BigBlueButton client uses Flex 3 components). Click _Apply_. 

![flex-compiler](/images/flex/flex-compiler.png)

1. Right-click on the project, click _Properties_ -> _Flex Build Path_. Click on _MX only_ component set. Make sure the libs directory is present in the _Library path_.

![flex-build-path](/images/flex/flex-build-path.png)

## Debugging with Flash Builder

  First we will set up our Flash Builder project for debugging.

1. Right-click on the project, go to _Debug As_ -> _Debug Configurations...._

2. Right-click on _Web Application_ -> _New_

3. Make sure the BigBlueButton client is in the _Project_ section and src/BigBlueButton.mxml is in the _Application file_.

4. Deselect _Use default_ and change the path to _about:blank_

5. Select _Apply_ and _Close_
   
   Flash Builder is now set up to debug with a client running remotely (ie. on your VM). It is important to note that you must still build the client using `ant` in your VM because Flash Builder won't build the full client.

![flex-debug](/images/flex/flex-debug.png)

  Before you are able to debug you need to have a browser installed and the [debug version](http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html) of Flash Player Debug for it.

  To start debugging:

1. Start a BigBlueButton session.

2. In Flash Builder, open the _Debug Configurations..._, select your previously created configuration, select _Debug_

3. Go back to browser and right-click the Flash content, select _Debugger_, select _Localhost_

4. In Flash Builder, wait for the launch progress to get above 50%

5. Go back to your browser and select _Connect_
   
   The debugger should now be connected and you should see output in the Flash Builder Console and breakpoints will activate. An alternative to steps 3-5 is to wait for the progress to get above 50% and then reload the BigBlueButton.html page in browser. The debugger should automatically connect when the Flash content has loaded.
   
   If you can see messages in the Flash Builder Console, but breakpoints aren't working you need to make sure that the version of the client in Flash Builder is the same as the version on your server. To do this do a full build of the client with `ant` on your server and refresh the project in Flash Builder (right-click the project -> _Refesh_) before running the debugger again. Sometimes the debugger still won't work after a refresh and you have to restart Flash Builder to get it running again.

# Pulling localization from Transifex

To pull the localization from Transifex, do the following steps

1. Install the Transifex client for Ubuntu

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip -y
$ sudo pip install transifex-client
```

2. Go to the locale folder

```bash
$ cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/locale 
```

3. Initialize the Transifex project

```bash
$ tx init

# Insert your transifex user and password
```

4. Set the BigBlueButton transifex resource

```bash
$ tx set --auto-remote https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bigbluebutton/resource/bbbresourcesproperties/
```

5. Edit the Transifex configuration file to filter the languages to match the BBB repository

```bash
$ vi .tx/config

file_filter = <lang>/bbbResources.properties 
```

6. Update all the languages from Transifex (updates only the languages existing in the current directory where the command is executed)

```bash
$ tx pull -f
```

    Pull all the languages from Transifex (download also languages which don't exist in the local directory where the command is executed, may download undesired language directories [lt, es_429])

```bash
$ tx pull -a --mode=onlytranslated
```

7. Sometimes Transifex downloads es_419 instead of es_LA (Latin American Spanish), in that case we need to manually update es_LA with what is in es_419

```bash
$ rm -r es_LA
$ cp es_419 es_LA
```

8. Add a gitignore to ignore the .tx folder or remove the .tx folder that is hidden

```bash
$ nano .gitignore
.tx
```

or

```bash
rm -r .tx
```

9. Compile to check you didn't break anything

```bash
$ cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
$ ant locales
```

# Developing BBB-Client-Check

First, let's navigate to the source code for the component

```bash
$ cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-client-check
```

Then modify the configurations fileto substitute your IP or domain name for the word HOST.

```bash
$ sed -i s/HOST/<IP or domain name>/g resources/config.xml.template
```

Next, let's build the component

```bash
$ ant
```

This will create a build of the bbb-client-check component in the `/home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-client-check/check` directory.

Next we need to create an nginx file to redirect calls to your development bbb-client-check.

```bash
$ echo "
location /check {
    root /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-client-check;
    index index.html index.htm;
}
" | sudo tee /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/check.nginx > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Now restart nginx and test the configuration:

```bash
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
$ sudo nginx -t
```

At this point you should be able to navigate to the check client page in your browser and use it. (e.x. http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/check)

When you make a change you will need to run `ant` again to rebuild the module.

# Build bbb-common-message

The bbb-common-message is required by a few components of BigBlueButton. So it is required to build this
first. Otherwise, you will run into compile errors.

```bash
$ cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-common-message
$ ./deploy.sh
```

# Developing BBB-Web

First, we need to update the latest bigbluebutton.properties file according to your setup. Basically, you will have to change the URL and security salt. If you don't know your salt, run `sudo bbb-conf --salt`

```bash
$ cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/

# Edit the file and change the values of bigbluebutton.web.serverURL and securitySalt. 
$ vi bigbluebutton-web/grails-app/conf/bigbluebutton.properties
```

Now you need to give your user account access to upload slides to the presentation directory and also access to write log files.

```bash
$ sudo chmod -R ugo+rwx /var/bigbluebutton
$ sudo chmod -R ugo+rwx /var/log/bigbluebutton
```

Now you need to create the nginx file that will redirect calls to your development bbb-web.

```bash
echo "
# Handle request to bbb-web running within Tomcat. This is for
# the BBB-API and Presentation.
location /bigbluebutton {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8989;
    proxy_redirect default;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

    # Allow 30M uploaded presentation document.
    client_max_body_size 30m;
    client_body_buffer_size 128k;

    proxy_connect_timeout 90;
    proxy_send_timeout 90;
    proxy_read_timeout 90;

    proxy_buffer_size 4k;
    proxy_buffers 4 32k;
    proxy_busy_buffers_size 64k;
    proxy_temp_file_write_size 64k;

    include fastcgi_params;
}
" | sudo tee /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web_dev > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Now we just need to create a link to make sure that the requests are redirected properly then restart nginx.

```bash
$ sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web_dev /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web.nginx
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

Open the file `~/.sbt/0.13/global.sbt` using your editor

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.sbt/0.13
$ vi ~/.sbt/0.13/global.sbt
```

Add the following into it

```scala
resolvers += "Artima Maven Repository" at "http://repo.artima.com/releases"
```

Build bbb-common-web

```bash
$ cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-common-web
$ ./deploy.sh
```

Now let's start grails webapp.

```bash
$ cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-web/
```

Download the necessary libraries.

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

Start grails and tell to listen on port 8989

```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

or

```bash
$ grails -reloading -Dserver.port=8989 run-app
```

If you get an error `Could not resolve placeholder 'apiVersion'`, just run `grails -Dserver.port=8989 run-war` again. The error is grails not picking up the "bigbluebutton.properties" the first time.

Now test again if you can join the demo meeting.

The command above will run a development version of bbb-web, but if you want to deploy your custom-built bbb-web you need to package a war file.

```bash
$ grails war
```

This will create a file with the name bigbluebutton-0.9.0.war. The version number for the file doesn't matter, but you should rename the war file to bigbluebutton.war. You then need to deploy the archive to tomcat. You can do this by simply copying it into the tomcat7 webapps directory.

```bash
$ sudo cp target/bigbluebutton-0.9.0.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/bigbluebutton.war
```

And now just restart tomcat.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart tomcat7 
```

If you changed the linking of web.nginx as instructed above you will need to also revert that back to the packaged location for bbb-web.

```bash
$ sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web.nginx
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

# Developing the Red5 Applications

You need to make `red5/webapps` writeable. Otherwise, you will get a permission error when you try to deploy into Red5.

```bash
$ sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/share/red5/webapps
```

## Developing BBB-Apps

Before you build and deploy bbb-apps you need to make sure that red5 service is stopped.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop red5
```

First we have to compile bbb-apps-common

```bash
$ cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-apps-common
$ sbt clean
$ sbt publish publishLocal
```

Now you can compile and deploy bigbluebutton-apps.

```bash
$ cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-apps
$ ./deploy.sh
```

And finally, you can start the red5 service up again.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start red5
```

## Developing BBB-Video

First, you need to stop red5.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop red5
```

Then you can compile and deploy the application.

```bash
$ cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-video
$ gradle resolveDeps
$ gradle war deploy
```

And finally, start red5 up again.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start red5 
```

## Developing Akka-Apps

First you need to stop bbb-apps-akka service.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop bbb-apps-akka 
```

Then you can manually run the application.

```bash
$ cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/akka-bbb-apps
$ sbt clean
$ sbt run
```

## Developing Akka-FSESL

First, you need to stop bbb-fsesl-akka service.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop bbb-fsesl-akka
```

You need to build the FS ESL library

```bash
$ cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-fsesl-client
$ sbt publish publishLocal
```

Then you can run the application.

```bash
$ cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/akka-bbb-fsesl
$ sbt clean
$ sbt run
```

## Developing BBB-Voice

First, you need to stop red5.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop bbb-red5 
```

Then you can compile and deploy the application.

```bash
$ cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-voice
$ gradle resolveDeps
$ gradle war deploy
```

And finally, start red5 up again.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start bbb-red5 
```

## Developing Screen Sharing

See the the [README](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/tree/v2.0.x-release/bbb-screenshare) file in the `bbb-screenshare` directory for details on how to compile and sign the Screen Sharing applet.

# Troubleshooting

## Connecting to the server

When the BigBlueButton client loads, it runs a number of modules: chat, voice, desktop sharing, and presentation.  Each of these modules makes a connection back to their corresponding BigBlueButton server components.

The URL for each connection is specified in [config.xml](/install/configuration-files.html#modules).

When setting up a development environment for the client, the `config.xml` file for the BigBlueButton client is now loaded from `~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/client/conf/config.xml`.  This means that any changes made to the default `config.xml` by `sudo bbb-conf --setip <hostname>` will _not_ affect the `config.xml` in your development environment.  Thus, if you change your hostname or IP address for the BigBlueButton server, you'll need to manually change the `config.xml` for your development environment.

## Welcome to Nginx page

If you get the "Welcome to Nginx" page. Check if bigbluebutton is enabled in nginx. You should see **bigbluebutton** in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.

If not, enable it.

```bash
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bigbluebutton

$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

## Old Translation

If you get a "Old Translation" warning when starting the client, in `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config.xml` change

```xml
<localeversion suppressWarning="false">0.71</localeversion>
```

to

```xml
<localeversion suppressWarning="false">0.9.0</localeversion>
```

## Warning: Try increasing the code cache size

If you get a compiler warning during the building of bbb-client, such as

```
build-polling:
    [mxmlc] Loading configuration file /home/dwelch/dev/tools/flex-4.5.0.20967/frameworks/flex-config.xml
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: CodeCache is full. Compiler has been disabled.
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Try increasing the code cache size using -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=
    [mxmlc] /home/dwelch/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/client/PollingModule.swf (232039 bytes)
```

Add the following to `~/.profile`

```
export ANT_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=1024m"
```

and then reload the .profile with the command `source ~/.profile`.

## Pausing/Restarting VM gives wrong date in commit

If you are developing using a VM and you've paused the VM and later restart it, the time on the VM will be incorrect. The incorrect time will affect any commits you do in GitHub.

To ensure your VM has the correct time, you can install ntp with

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ntp
$ sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart
```

and then do the following after starting the VM from a paused state

```bash
$ sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart
```

The above will re-sync your clock.

# Setup Samba

To setup Samba

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y --force-yes samba
```

Then setup your shared directory by editing `/etc/samba/smb.conf`

```ini
; BigBlueButton: Share the development directory
[ubuntu]
   comment = BigBlueButton Development share
   path = /home/ubuntu
   browseable = yes
   read only = no
   create mask = 0755
   directory mask = 0775
   guest ok = yes
   force user = ubuntu
```
