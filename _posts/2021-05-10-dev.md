This document guides you through setting up a development environment for BigBlueButton 2.3 (referred hereafter as BigBlueButton).

## Install BBB 2.3

### Install basic deps
Install needed tools
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install curl wget net-tools software-properties-common haveged apt-transport-https openjdk-8-jdk -y
```
Add needed repositories
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bigbluebutton/support -y
```
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rmescandon/yq -y
```
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa
```
Upgrade packages
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

### Install MongoDB
Add key for MongoDB's repository
```bash
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
Add APT's source for MongoDB
```bash
echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.2 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.2.list
```
Install MongoDB
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
```


### Install Node.js
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

### Install BigBlueButton
Add key for BigBlueButton
```bash
wget https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/repo/bigbluebutton.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
```
Add APT's source for BigBlueButton
```bash
echo "deb https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bionic-230 bigbluebutton-bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
```
Install it
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton
```

### (Optional) Install bbb-demo
If you want to test the installation, you can install demos:
```bash
sudo apt-get install bbb-demo
```
Before testing, make sure you have set `secure: false` in `/usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/application.yml` file:
```yml
# ...
server:
    session:
        cookie:
            secure: false
# ...

```
You can access http://BBB_IP_ADDRESS , and you will be able to join bbb-demo
(probably WebRTC media won't work because it needs HTTPS to be set).
BBB_IP_ADDRESS is the ip address of your container/machine running this
installation.

## Set up HTTPS
Follow [2.2's Configure SSL on your BigBlueButton server](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/install.html#configure-ssl-on-your-bigbluebutton-server)

## Set up development environment
Follow [2.2's Setup a Development Environment](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/dev.html#setup-a-development-environment)

#### Additional steps for developing bbb-html5
Starting with BigBlueButton 2.3-alpha7 bbb-html5 clients sessions are handled by a pool of "frontend" bbb-html5 nodejs instances loadbalanced by NginX. When you are running the source code via `npm start` however, you are only running a single nodejs process and the loadbalancing configuration may be an obstacle. You would want to make a change in `/etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/bbb-html5.nginx` so you do not use the html5 pool but rather only the 4100 port.

The default - used for production mode:
```
location ~ ^/html5client/ {
  # proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4100; # use for development
  proxy_pass http://poolhtml5servers; # use for production
  ...
```

Development mode, only port 4100 is used.
```
location ~ ^/html5client/ {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4100; # use for development
  # proxy_pass http://poolhtml5servers; # use for production
  ...
```

After this change, reload NginX's configuration with `sudo systemctl reload nginx`

A symptom of running `npm start` with the incompatible `poolhtml5servers` NginX configuration is seeing `It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port.` and `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected Identifier`



When you switch back to running the `bbb-html5` packaged version you would want to revert your change so the `poolhtml5servers` are used for spreading the load of the client sessions.

BigBlueButton 2.3-alpha7 also introduced [bigbluebutton-html5/deploy_to_usr_share.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/v2.3-alpha-7/bigbluebutton-html5/deploy_to_usr_share.sh) - a script which deploys your [customized] bigbluebutton-html5/* code as locally running `bbb-html5` package (production mode, requiring the `poolhtml5servers` NginX rule)
