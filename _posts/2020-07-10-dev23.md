BigBlueButton 2.3-dev (referred hereafter as "BigBlueButton 2.3") is the next version of BigBlueButton currently under development.  This page gives you an overview of what is in the next release, along with steps for administrators to setup a BigBlueButton 2.3 server (for testing) and developers the steps to setup a development environment.

The core BigBlueButton developers have been working on BigBlueButton 2.3 since since fall of 2019.  However, due to Covid-19 and the widespread adoption of 2.2, we refocused our development on making incremental improvements and fixes to 2.2.  Since then, we've periodically merged the updates to 2.2 into BigBlueButton 2.3.

BigBlueButton 2.3 includes about 500 commits over 2.2.  In this regard, BigBlueButton 2.3 builds upon and further improves the stability and performance of the 2.2.  Highlights of BigBlueButton 2.3 include

  * Notifications for raise hand,
  * Ability to put camera left/right of presentation, and
  * Whiteboard performance improvements

Under the hood, BigBlueButton 2.3 installs on Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit, which allows us to move to using more modern components that include

  * Node 12.x (the LTS release of node), 
  * ruby 2.5, and 
  * meteor 1.6.  

Gone are the Flash-related packages for `bbb-client` and `red5` (in this way BigBlueButton 2.3 installs less components than 2.2).  For full details on what is new in BigBlueButton 2.3, see [release notes](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.3-alpha-1).

## Giving feedback and reporting bugs
BigBlueButton 2.3 is under active development.  While we don't recommend setting it up in a production environment, but we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our bigbluebutton-dev mailing list.  

If you found a reproducible bug,  please report it in the [GitHub Issues section](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues) with steps to reproduce (this will make it easier for the developers to fix the bug).  Indicate in the body of the bug report that this applies to BigBlueButton 2.3 and give us the client build number, which you can find either with `dpkg -l | grep bbb-html5` or within the client in the `Settings -> About` menu.


## Installation
BigBlueButton 2.3 requires the same [minimal requirements]( https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/install.html#minimum-server-requirements) as 2.2 with one notable exception: you need to install it on Ubuntu 18.04.

To setup BigBlueButton 2.3, we recommend using [bbb-install tool](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) and passing the version `-v bionic-230-dev`.

The following command will get you a snapshot build of BigBlueButton 2.3 with the API examples (`-a`) and the default firewall (`-w`).  You'll also need to substitute your domain name for `bbb.example.com` and email address for `info@example.com`.

`# wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -w -v bionic-230-dev -s bbb.example.com -e info@example.com -a -w`

After installation you should see the following packages (your version numbers may be slightly different).

```
# dpkg -l | grep bbb

```

If you've setup earlier versions of BigBlueButton, you'll note that there are fewer packages in 2.3.  Gone are the `bbb-red5` package and its associated `bbb-apps-*` packages.  These were used by the Flash client package `bbb-client` which is gone as well.

## Development
In order to set up a development environment for 2.3 you can follow the [steps from 2.2](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/dev.html)
However, Ubuntu 18.04 ships with Java 11 set as default option but we need to set Java 8 to be default (subject to change)

If you see something similar while trying to compile bbb-common-messages or bbb-apps-akka:

```
[error] /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-common-message/src/main/java/org/bigbluebutton/common2/redis/RedisStorageService.java:25:1: package com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations is not visible
[error]   (package com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations is declared in module java.xml, which does not export it)
[error] import com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations.Bool;
```

Most likely you have a different version of Java. Follow the solution described here: 
https://askubuntu.com/a/740782
Namely `update-java-alternatives --list`

## Known issues
- As of July 10, 2020 the document conversion using liberoffice is still being updated to run within Docker, so at the moment any office conversions will fail.  Upload of PDF slides still convert fine.
