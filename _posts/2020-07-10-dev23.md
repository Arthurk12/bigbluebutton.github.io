This page covers the steps you need to set up BigBlueButton 2.3-dev (still in development).


BigBlueButton 2.3.x is aiming at improving further the stability and performance of the previous versions.
In July 2020 we released an early preview ["alpha" version](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.3-alpha-1) including about 500 commits of changes over 2.2.x. This page contains instructions for installing BigBlueButton 2.3 and specifically any new steps introduced after version 2.2.

## Installation
You need a server with a new installation of Ubuntu Bionic 18.04. The same requirements for the server apply as with previous BigBlueButton versions - see https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/install.html#minimum-server-requirements
The best way to install BigBlueButton is using the [bbb-install tool](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install).
The parameter specifying version 2.3 is `-v bionic-230-dev`

Sample command:

`# wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -w -v bionic-230-dev -a -w`


## Development
In order to set up a development environment for 2.3 you can follow the [steps from 2.2](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/dev.html)
However, Ubuntu 18.04 ships with Java 11 set as default option but we need to set Java 8 to be default (subject to change)

If you see something similar while trying to compile bbb-common-messages or bbb-apps-akka:

```
[error] /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-common-message/src/main/java/org/bigbluebutton/common2/redis/RedisStorageService.java:25:1: package com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations is not visible
[error]   (package com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations is declared in module java.xml, which does not export it)
[error] import com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations.Bool;
```

Most likely you have a different version of Java. Follow the solution described here: 
https://askubuntu.com/a/740782
Namely `update-java-alternatives --list`

- as of July 10, 2020 the document conversion is undergoing multiple changes, so some types of presentation files will not convert. This is a known issue.
