BigBlueButton 2.3-dev is the next version of BigBlueButton currently under development.  It focuses on increased engagement, improved usability, and more performance.

This page gives you an overview of how to install the latest stable build of 2.3-dev and the features contained in the release.

BigBlueButton 2.3-dev builds upon BigBlueButton 2.2. As we updated 2.2 in 2020, we perodically merged in the improvements to the 2.3-dev codebase.  In this regard, BigBlueButton 2.3-dev builds upon and further improves the stability and performance of the 2.2 version.  Compared with 2.2, the notable improvements in 2.3-dev are 

Highlights of BigBlueButton 2.3-dev include

Engagement
  * Notifications for raise hand
  * Improved polling (in development)
  * Select individual users for whiteboard (in development)

Usability
  * Left/right camera placement
  * Non-blocking presentation upload
  * Notification when mic is muted while speaking
  * User avatars

Performance
  * Better handling of large number of meetings due to multiple nodejs processes (configurable)
  * Whiteboard performance improvements
  * Layout Context and Layout Manager
  * Participants list and chat performance improvements
  * Support for multiple nodejs processes


BigBlueButton 2.3-dev installs on Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit.  The newer version of Ubuntu brings in more modern components for 2.3

  * Node 12.x (the LTS release of node), 
  * ruby 2.5, and 
  * meteor 1.10.2  

For full details on what is new in BigBlueButton 2.3-dev, see the release notes for 

  * [alpha-1](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.3-alpha-1)
  * [alpha-2](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.3-alpha-2).
  * [alpha-3](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.3-alpha-3).


## Installation

BigBlueButton 2.3-dev requires the same [minimal requirements]( https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/install.html#minimum-server-requirements) as 2.2, with the following notable diferences

  * Ubuntu 18.04 
  * docker (Libreoffice now runs within a docker container)

The requirement for docker may preculde running 2.3-dev within some virtualized environments, such as LXC and containerd.  We may offer an alternative of running BigBlueButton outside of Docker (as in 2.2) to remain compatible with some virtualization environments. 

To install 2.3-dev, use [bbb-install tool](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install).  The following example installs the latest stable biuld of 2.3-dev with API examples (`-a`) and firewall (`-w`).  You'll also need to substitute `<hostname>` with the external hostname of your server and `<email>` with your email address (these two parameters are needed to automatically generate a Let's Encrypt certificate).

```bash
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v bionic-230-dev -s <hostname> -e <email> -a -w
```

After installation finishes you should see the following installed packages (your version numbers may be slightly different).

```bash
# dpkg -l | grep bbb-
ii  bbb-apps-akka               2.3.0-21        all          BigBlueButton Apps (Akka)

```

Gone are the Flash-related packages for `bbb-client` and `red5`.

In 2.3-dev, you can enable multiple bbb-html5 nodejs processes on your server for improved performace.  Edit `/etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-conf/apply-config.sh` and add `setNumberOfHTML5Processes 2`, specifies that you want two bbb-html5 nodejs processes. The current choices are 1-4, where 1 is the default.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Pull in the helper functions for configuring BigBlueButton
source /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-conf/apply-lib.sh

setNumberOfHTML5Processes 2
```


## Setup development environment 

To set up a development environment for 2.3-dev, follow the [steps from 2.2](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/dev.html).

BigBlueButton 2.3-dev uses Java 8; however, Ubuntu 18.04 ships with Java 11 set as default option.  If you see something similar while trying to compile bbb-common-messages or bbb-apps-akka:

```
[error] /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-common-message/src/main/java/org/bigbluebutton/common2/redis/RedisStorageService.java:25:1: package com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations is not visible
[error]   (package com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations is declared in module java.xml, which does not export it)
[error] import com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations.Bool;
```

You can use [update-java-alternatives --list](https://askubuntu.com/a/740782) to switch to Java 8 version as default.


## Features

For this upcoming release, we’ve focused our efforts on improving the experience from the instructor’s perspective in two key areas:

**Usability** - making the product easier to use for the the instructor

**Engagement** - giving the instructor more ways to engage their students

### Usability

#### Quickly choose a presentation

The '+' button now lists the uploaded presentations for quick and easy switching.

<img src="/images/22-choose-presentation.png" alt="Choose Presentation" width="50%" height="50%">

#### Notifications options in Settings

You can now get notifications for Raise Hand.

<img src="/images/22-settings-notifications.png" alt="Notifications options" width="50%" height="50%">

#### Repositioning webcams

Providing users with move flexibility of the client by allowing them to move the webcams to the right and left-hand side of the presentation.

#### Uploaded slides in the background

You can continue engaging with students as the upload and processing of presentations now happens in the background.

#### Network quality indicator

BigBlueButton will proactively notify a user if they may have connectivity issues. As a moderator (instructor), you can see if any student might be having having connectivity issues.

#### Smart Poll button with choices

The Smart Poll button now appears on the toolbar and shows the polling option.

#### Polling results in the chat experience

The poll results will also show in the chat. This helps make the poll results visible when the presentation is not visible, such as when sharing your screen.

#### Raise hand notification

You can receive an audio and/or popup alert when a student raises their hand.


### Engagement

#### Per-user whiteboard

You can give a specific student ability to write on the whiteboard (as opposed to all students).

#### Typed responses to polling questions
As a presenter,  you can provide a written question for a poll response. From the users point of view, they will be prompted to type in their response. 

#### Randomly choose a user
We are now providing presenters with the option to randomly pick a student in the class. Everyone will see a brief animation of names before it settles down on a given student.


## Giving feedback and reporting bugs

BigBlueButton 2.3-dev is under active development.  While we don't recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our bigbluebutton-dev mailing list.  

If you found a reproducible bug,  please report it in the [GitHub Issues section](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues) with steps to reproduce (this will make it easier for the developers to fix the bug).  Indicate in the body of the bug report that this applies to BigBlueButton 2.3-dev and give us the client build number, which you can find either with `dpkg -l | grep bbb-html5` or within the client in the `Settings -> About` menu.
