This document gives you an overview of BigBlueButton 2.3-dev, which is currently under active development.  BigBlueButton 2.3-dev (hereafter referred to as simply 2.3) builds upon 2.2 and offers users improved usability, increased engagement, and more performance.

  * **Usability** - making common functions (such as raise hand) easier 
  * **Engagement** - giving the instructor more ways to engage students
  * **Performance** - increasing overall performance and scalability

Here's a breakdown of what's coming in 2.3.

  * **Usability** 
    * Non-blocking upload of presentations
    * Left/right placement of camera relative to presentation
    * User avatars
    * New playback format with search capability
    * Notifications for raise hand and guest waiting approval
    * Screen share of a Chrome tab can also share system audio
    * Notification when speaking and microphone is muted
    * Ability to switch microphone input and audio output 
    * Connectivity status icon

  * **Engagement**
    * Easier creation of polls and new option to receive typed user responses
    * Assign individual users whiteboard privileges
    * Randomly select a user 

  * **Performance** 
    * User list and chat list now re-render only visible components
    * Refactoring of user joining sequence
    * Support for multiple nodejs processes for supporting meetings larger than 100 users 
    * Whiteboard performance improvements
    * Faster queue based processing of launching recordings workers
    * Configurable pool of recording workers (default 1)
    * Faster processing of recordings

This release, by design, does not introduce any large-scale UI changes.  All the features in 2.2 are in their familiar place, making it easy for users to transition to the newer version.

Under the hood, BigBlueButton 2.3 installs on Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit, which is a much newer version of Ubuntu that brings along updates to key components

  * Node 12.x (the LTS release of node)
  * ruby 2.5
  * meteor 1.10.x  
  * Etherpad 1.8.13
  * FreeSWITCH 1.10.6
  * LibreOffice 7.0.4.2

# Features

The following sections give details of the new features.

## New player for recordings

BigBlueButtom 2.3 has a rewritten HTML5 player for recordings that gives the user the ability to 
  * search through text of slides, 
  * view both webcam and screen share/presentation, and
  * view both integrated shard notes and chat.

<img src="/images/22-playback-overview.png" alt="Overview" />
<br /><br />

The presentation area displays the current slide or screenshare.

### Layout controls

The layout controls appear in the upper right-hand corner.

<img src="/images/22-playback-layout.png" alt="Layout" />
<br /><br />

These controls let you quickly

  * do a full-text search of all slides in the recording,
  * swap the webcam area with the presentation area, and
  * view presentation area full-screen.

### Thumbnail navigation

All slides in the recording appear as a row of thumbnails below the presentation area.  The player highlights the current slide in the playback.

<img src="/images/22-playback-thumb.png" alt="Thumbnails" />
<br /><br />

You can click on any slide to jump to that segment of the playback.  

<img src="/images/22-playback-thumbnails.png" alt="Thumbnails" />
<br /><br />

A screenshare icon will appear for any segment of the recording that contains a screenshare.

### Show chat/shared notes

The chat area shows all the chat and shared notes for the session.

<img src="/images/22-playback-chat.png" alt="Chat" width="50%">
<br /><br />

Click the shared notes and chat icons to switch between the views.  The shared notes shows the final state of shared notes when the recording ended.

The chat messages are clickable, enabling the user to quickly advance to the recording at the point which that chat message was entered.  Poll results now appear in the chat as well.

### Search

When creating the recording, BigBlueButton extracts the text for each slide.

Clicking the magnifying glass icon will bring up a search dialog box that lets enter text and show only the slides that contain that text.  In the screenshot below, the user typed 'avoc' and found one slide contained that text.

<img src="/images/22-playback-search2.png" alt="Search" width="50%">
<br /><br />

Clicking the search icon will apply the search filter to the thumbnails.  The user can then click a thumbnail to advance to that segment in the recording that has the search text on the slide.

<img src="/images/22-playback-results.png" alt="Search" width="50%">
<br /><br />

Clicking the 'x' button clears the search and displays all thumbnails again.

### Playback speed

The playback control lets the user adjust the playback speed for the recording.

<img src="/images/22-playback-speed.png" alt="Search" width="25%">
<br /><br />

## Usability

### Quickly choose a presentation

When you upload a presentation, the '+' shows a list of all uploaded presentations, making it very easy to switch between them.

<img src="/images/22-choose-presentation.png" alt="Choose Presentation" width="25%">
<br /><br />

### Notifications of raise hand

Moderators have two additional notifications: raise hands and guest waiting.

<img src="/images/23-moderator-notifications.png" alt="Moderator notifications" width="50%">
<br /><br />

For raise hands, a persistent toast notification will appear when a student raises their hand.  The notification will remain the screen as long as at least one student has their hand raised.

<img src="/images/23-two-students.png" alt="multiple notifications" width="50%">
<br /><br />

The teacher can lower individual hands by clicking on user's avatar in the notification -  for example, clicking on 'Ma' will lower Matthew Thomas's hand) - or the teacher can lower all hands and close the dialog by clicking "Lower Hands".

To make it easier to raise/lower your hand, users now have a Raise Hand button on the toolbar.

<img src="/images/23-raise-hand.png" alt="Moderator notifications" width="50%">
<br /><br />

The Raise Hand button is a one-click shortcut for a clicking on your avatar, choosing Set status, and choosing Raise hand.


<br /><br />

### Repositioning webcams

The webcams can now appear on the left or right of the presentation, maximizing the available viewing area for the presentation.

<img src="/images/bigbluebutton-repositioning-webcams.png" alt="Repositioning webcams" width="75%">
<br /><br />

### Uploaded slides in the background

When upload slides, the presenter immediately returns to the main window and can continue to engage students as the slides upload in the background.  

<img src="/images/bigbluebutton-uploaded-slides.png" alt="BigBlueButton uploaded slides" width="50%">
<br /><br />

### Network connectivity icon

A network connectivity status icon now appears in the upper right-hand corner.  This icon will show green when connectivity is good, and will change when the client detects a degraded connection or loss of connection.


<img src="/images/23-connectivity-bad.gif" alt="BigBlueButton connectivity indicator" width="75%">
<br /><br />

This icon shows green when the BigBlueButton client has a stable connection.  If the client looses connection to the server, the connectivity icon will turn red and the client will attempt to reconnect. 

The icon is clickable.  When clicked, a dialog appears that lets the user turn off webcam and/or screen share videos to reduce bandwidth. 

<img src="/images/23-connectivity-dialog.png" alt="BigBlueButton connectivity indicator" width="75%">
<br /><br />

The dialog will also show a recent log of connectivity changes.  Here shows the user that at 8:11 am the client detected that the network connection was degraded.

Note: The design of the network icons and color are still under development.


### User connectivity log for moderators

To help moderators see if any users are having connectivity issues, a moderator can choose "Connectivity status" (found in the gear-icon in the user's list) to see a log of past connectivity messages shown to users.

<img src="/images/bigbluebutton-connection-status.png" alt="BigBlueButton connection status" width="75%">
<br /><br />

If a user is saying the instructor's audio is not sounding good, and the Connectivity status shows that user was recently shown a message that their client might be experiencing networking issues, then the poor audio is likely a result of networking issues.

Note: The design of the Connectivity status dialog is still under development.

### Smart Poll button with choices

The Smart Poll button now appears on the toolbar and shows the polling option.

<img src="/images/bigbluebutton-smart-poll.png" alt="BigBlueButton smart polling" width="75%">

<br /><br />

### Polling results in the chat experience

The poll results will also show in the chat. This helps make the poll results visible when the presentation is not visible, such as when sharing your screen.

<img src="/images/bigbluebutton-polling-results.png" alt="BigBlueButton connection status" width="50%">
<br /><br />

### Screen share system audio when sharing Chrome tab

When you screen share using Chrome and choose sharing a Chrome Tab, you can now include system audio from that tab.  Users viewing the screen share will be able to hear any audio broadcasted from that tab. 

To include the audio, choose `Chrome Tab` as check the `Share audio` option in the bottom left-hand corner.

<img src="/images/23-screen-share-tab.png" alt="Screen share tab" width="50%">
<br /><br />


### Notification of talking when muted

When talking with a muted microphone, BigBlueButton will now show a message that you are muted. 

<img src="/images/23-unmute-mic.png" alt="Unmute microphone" width="50%">
<br /><br />


## Engagement

### Per-user whiteboard

You can give a specific student the ability to write on the whiteboard (instead of all students).

<img src="/images/23-give-whiteboard.png" alt="BigBlueButton per-user whiteboard access" width="50%">
<br /><br />

Once you have given an individual user whiteboard access, a pen icon appears next to their avatar.  

<img src="/images/23-received-whiteboard.png" alt="BigBlueButton per-user whiteboard access" width="50%">
<br /><br />

You can revoke individual whiteboard access by clicking their avatar again and choosing "Remove whiteboard access"

<img src="/images/23-take-whiteboard.png" alt="BigBlueButton per-user whiteboard access" width="50%">
<br /><br />

When granting individual whiteboard access, a count will appear on the multi-user whiteboard icon showing you how many students you have granted access to the whiteboard.

<img src="/images/23-notification-of-whiteboard.png" alt="BigBlueButton per-user whiteboard access" width="50%">
<br /><br />

Clicking the multi-user whiteobard icon removes whiteboard access from everyone except the presenter.


<br /><br />

### Easier editing of polling choices

The preset choices for polling -- True/False, A/B/C/D, Yes/No/Abstention -- are now just default labels for a given list of polling choices.

The presenter can now click the '+' to add a new polling option, or the trash icon to remove a polling option.

<img src="/images/bigbluebutton-polling-typed-response.png" alt="BigBlueButton polling typed responses" width="75%">

### Typed responses to polling questions

There is a new polling choice called **User Response**.  With User Response, you can have students provide a written response to a poll question.  From the user's point of view, when prompted, they will see a dialog box in the lower right-hand corner.

<img src="/images/23-user-reponse.png" alt="BigBlueButton polling typed responses" width="75%">


<br /><br />

### Randomly choose a user


You can have BigBlueButton randomly pick a user in the class.  You and the student chosen will see the choice after a brief animation.

<img src="/images/bigbluebutton-randomly-select-a-user.png" alt="BigBlueButton randomly select a user" width="50%">
<br /><br />

<img src="/images/bigbluebutton-selected-user.png" alt="BigBlueButton selected user" width="50%">
<br /><br />

You need at least two other users in the session.


# Installation

For server requirements, BigBlueButton 2.3 needs similar [minimum server requirements](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/install.html#minimum-server-requirements) as 2.2, with two important differences

  * Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit
  * docker (Libreoffice now runs within a docker container)

The requirement for docker may preclude running 2.3 within some virtualized environments, such as LXC and containerd; however, it ensures libreoffice runs within a restricted sandbox for document conversion.  We are exploring if we can run libreoffice within systemd (such as systemd-nspawn).

To install 2.3, use [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install).  For example, the following command installs BigBlueButton 2.3-dev using `bbb.example.com` as the hostname and `notice@example.com` as the email for Let's Encrypt (you would substitute these values for your own hostname and email address).  Notice the version is `-v bionic-230`, which will install the latest release of BigBlueButto 2.3-dev.

```bash
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v bionic-230 -s bbb.example.com -e notice@example.com  -a -w
```

After installation finishes, you should see the following installed packages (your version numbers may be slightly different).

```bash
# dpkg -l | grep bbb-
ii  bbb-apps-akka             2.3.0-21        all      BigBlueButton Apps (Akka)
ii  bbb-config                1:2.3.0-21      amd64    BigBlueButton configuration utilities
ii  bbb-demo                  1:2.3.0-2       amd64    BigBlueButton API demos
ii  bbb-etherpad              1:2.3.0-13      amd64    The EtherPad Lite components for BigBlueButton
ii  bbb-freeswitch-core       2:2.3.0-7       amd64    BigBlueButton build of FreeSWITCH
ii  bbb-freeswitch-sounds     1:1.6.7-1       amd64    FreeSWITCH Sounds
ii  bbb-fsesl-akka            2.3.0-11        all      BigBlueButton FS-ESL (Akka)
ii  bbb-html5                 1:2.3.0-1311    amd64    The HTML5 components for BigBlueButton
ii  bbb-libreoffice-docker    1:2.3.0-7       amd64    BigBlueButton setup for LibreOffice running in docker
ii  bbb-mkclean               1:0.8.7-1       amd64    Clean and optimize Matroska and WebM files
ii  bbb-playback-presentation 1:2.3.0-6       amd64    BigBluebutton playback of presentation
ii  bbb-record-core           1:2.3.0-11      amd64    BigBlueButton record and playback
ii  bbb-web                   1:2.3.0-25      amd64    BigBlueButton API
ii  bbb-webrtc-sfu            1:2.3.0-9       amd64    BigBlueButton WebRTC SFU
```

This installs the latest version of BigBlueButton 2.3-dev with Let's encrypt certificate and the API demos.  With the API demos installed, you can open https://<hostname>/ in a browser (where <hostname> is the hostname you specified in the `bbb-install.sh` command), enter your name, and click 'Join' to join 'Demo Meeting'.  For more information, see the [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) documentation.


# Customizations

## Increase number of processes for nodejs

BigBlueButton 2.2 used a single `nodejs` process for all client-side communication.  This process would start to bottleneck (the `nodejs` process, running on a single CPU core, started to use 100% of the core).  Because `nodejs` was running on a single CPU core, having a 16 or 32 CPU core server for BigBlueButton 2.2 failed to yield much additional scalability.

BigBlueButton 2.3 moves away from a single `nodejs` process for `bbb-html5` towards multiple `nodejs` processes handling incoming messages from clients.  This means that `bbb-html5` could use multiple CPU cores for processing messages and handling browser sessions (each `nodejs` process runs on a single CPU core).

As of [2.3-alpha-7](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.3-alpha-7), `bbb-html5` will use have 2 "frontend" and two "backend" processes (this value is configurable in `/usr/share/meteor/bundle/bbb-html5-with-roles.conf`).  A restart of BigBlueButton is required if you make changes to these files.

The breakdown of functionality between front-end and back-end is as follows

#### Frontend(s):
 - receive the `ValidateAuthTokenResp` event to complete authentication
 - collection subscription and publishing
 - other DDP events including method calls to send events to `akka-apps`
 - handle completely the Streamer redis events: Cursor, Annotations, External video share
 - still require `MeetingStarted` and `MeetingEnded` events to create/destroy per-meeting event processing queues

#### Backend(s):
 - handle all the non-streamer events
 - if more than one backend is running, bbb-web splits the load in round-robin fashion by assigning an `instanceId`. So individual backends only process redis events for the meetings matching the associated `instanceId`
 - `ValidateAuthTokenResp` is passed to backends as well, which is needed for the cases where you only have a backend, no frontends - for example dev environments that do not need to care about scaling

When you use `sudo bbb-conf --setip <hostname>` or `sudo bbb-conf --restart`, `bbb-conf` will run `/etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-conf/apply-config.sh` between shutdown and restart of the BigBlueButton processes.  In this way, you can change configuration values of BigBlueButton, or use some of the helper functions in `apply-lib.sh`.  See [Automatically apply configuration changes on restart](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/customize.html#automatically-apply-configuration-changes-on-restart).

### Log monitoring for bbb-html5
In BigBlueButton 2.3 we run multiple nodejs processes in production mode, so tailing logs is slightly different from `journalctl -f bbb-html5.service` which was used in 2.2. Rather than listing all the services ( `bbb-html5-backend@1.service   bbb-html5-backend@2.service   bbb-html5-frontend@1.service  bbb-html5-frontend@2.service  bbb-html5-frontend@3.service  bbb-html5-frontend@4.service ...` ) you can use the wildcard operator `*`. Notice the different process id for each bbb-html5-* service. Also notice `systemd_start_frontend.sh` signifying a log from a frontend process vs `systemd_start.sh` - backend process.

```
# journalctl -f -u bbb-html5-*
-- Logs begin at Mon 2021-03-15 12:13:05 UTC. --

## Increase number of recording workers

The previous versions of BigBlueButton used a single thread for processing recordings.  BigBlueButton 2.3-dev uses [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) to spawn multiple recording workers for processing recordings.  

By default, `/usr/lib/systemd/system/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service` defines one recording worker `Environment=COUNT=1`.  

```
[Unit]
Description=BigBlueButton resque worker for recordings

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/rake -f ../Rakefile resque:workers >> /var/log/bigbluebutton/bbb-rap-worker.log'
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts
Environment=QUEUE=rap:archive,rap:publish,rap:process,rap:sanity,rap:captions
Environment=COUNT=1
# Environment=VVERBOSE=1
User=bigbluebutton
Restart=always
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

If you want 3 recording workers, for example, the steps below show how to add a systemd override file in `/etc/systemd/system/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service.d/override.conf` that sets `Environment=COUNT=3` and restarts the `bbb-rap-resque-worker.service` service.


```
# mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service.d
# cat > override.conf << HERE
[Service]
Environment=COUNT=3
HERE
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl restart bbb-rap-resque-worker.service
# systemctl status bbb-rap-resque-worker.service
● bbb-rap-resque-worker.service - BigBlueButton resque worker for recordings
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
  Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service.d
           └─override.conf
   Active: active (running) since Sat 2021-01-09 12:19:22 UTC; 6s ago
 Main PID: 23630 (sh)
    Tasks: 15 (limit: 4915)
   CGroup: /system.slice/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service
      ├─23630 /bin/sh -c /usr/bin/rake -f ../Rakefile resque:workers >> /var/log/bigbluebutton/bbb-rap-worker.log
      ├─23631 /usr/bin/ruby /usr/bin/rake -f ../Rakefile resque:workers
      ├─23650 resque-2.0.0: Waiting for rap:archive,rap:publish,rap:process,rap:sanity,rap:captions
      ├─23651 resque-2.0.0: Waiting for rap:archive,rap:publish,rap:process,rap:sanity,rap:captions
      └─23652 resque-2.0.0: Waiting for rap:archive,rap:publish,rap:process,rap:sanity,rap:captions

```

`systemctl status bbb-rap-resque-worker.service` shows three resque workers ready to process upto three recordings in parallel.

The processing of recordings is also much faster thanks to the work of [abatu](https://github.com/abautu) in the community (see [#2483](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/2483)).

## Run three Kurento servers

Recommend running [three parallel Kurento servers](/2.2/customize.html#run-three-parallel-kurento-media-servers).

## Local overrides for configuration settings

One challenge in maintaining a BigBlueButton 2.2 server was the packaging scripts would largely overwrite the settings files.

In BigBlueButton 2.3 many of the configuration files have local overrides so the administrator can specify the local equivalents. 


| Package             | Override                                                                                    | Notes                        |
|:------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| /usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties              | /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-web.properties  |                              |
| /usr/share/bbb-apps-akka/conf/application.conf             | /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-apps-akka.conf                |                              |
| /usr/share/bbb-fsesl-akka/conf/application.conf              | /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-fsesl-akka.conf             |                              |
| /usr/share/meteor/bundle/programs/server/assets/app/config/settings.yml | /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-html5.yml        |                              |
| /usr/share/meteor/bundle/bbb-html5-with-roles.conf           | /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-html5-with-roles.conf       |                              |
| /usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/spring/turn-stun-servers.xml        | /etc/bigbluebutton/turn-stun-servers.xml | Replaces the original file   |
| /usr/local/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/config/default.yml | /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/production.yml     |                              |

 <br /><br />


For `bbb-web.properties`, the settings are name/value pair.  For example, the following `bbb-web.properties` overrides the settings for `bigbluebutton.web.serverURL` and `securitySalt` (shared secret).

```
#
# Use this file to override default entries in /usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties
#

bigbluebutton.web.serverURL=https://droplet-7162.meetbbb.com
securitySalt=UsanRxRk938d02cTWfAqSM9Cvin7bnzsREfqFfzpf2U
```


This override will ensure that `bbb-web` uses the above values regardless of changes the packaging scripts make to the upgrade.

For `bbb-apps-akka` and `bbb-fsesl-akka`, the settings file are formatted as shown below.  For example, the file `bbb-apps-akka.conf` overrides the settings for `/usr/share/bbb-apps-akka/conf/application.conf`.

```
// include default config from upstream
include "/usr/share/bbb-apps-akka/conf/application.conf"

// you can customize everything here. API endpoint and secret have to be changed
// This file will not be overridden by packages

services {
  bbbWebAPI="https://bbb.example.com/bigbluebutton/api"
  sharedSecret="UsanRxRk938d02cTWfAqSM9Cvin7bnzsREfqFfzpf2U"
}
```

For `bbb-html5.yml` the settings file are YAML formatted.  Any setting in this file overrides the corresponding setting in `/usr/share/meteor/bundle/programs/server/assets/app/config/settings.yml`.  For example, the following `bbb-html5.yml` overrides the values for `public.kurento.screenshare.constraints.audio` to `true`.

```
public:
  kurento:
    screenshare:
      constraints:
        audio: true
```





# Setup development environment
A few considerations before we start:
 - Required OS: Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic)
 - This is intended to run on containers/local-machine setup, such as LXC.
 - This process is similar to BBB 2.2's install. One difference is that we
 encapsulated Libreoffice in docker for increased security.
 - For public/production servers, we recommend installing BigBlueButton using
 [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install)



We'll do this in 3 steps:
* [Install BBB **2.3-dev** (detailed below)](#install-bbb-23-dev)
* [Setup SSL (same as 2.2)](#setup-https)
* [Setup development environment (same as 2.2)](#setup-development-environment-1)


## Install BBB 2.3-dev

### Install basic deps
Install needed tools
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install curl wget net-tools software-properties-common haveged apt-transport-https openjdk-8-jdk -y
```
Add needed repositories
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bigbluebutton/support -y
```
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rmescandon/yq -y
```
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa
```
Upgrade packages
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

### Install MongoDB
##### (Note: BBB 2.3-dev uses MongoDB 4.2, while BBB 2.2 uses MongoDB 3.4)
Add key for MongoDB's repository
```bash
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
Add APT's source for MongoDB
```bash
echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.2 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.2.list
```
Install MongoDB
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
```


### Install Node.js
##### (Note: BBB 2.3-dev uses Node.js 12.x, while BBB 2.2 uses Node.js 8.x)
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```


### Install BigBlueButton
Add key for BigBlueButton
```bash
wget https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/repo/bigbluebutton.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
```
Add APT's source for BigBlueButton
```bash
echo "deb https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bionic-230 bigbluebutton-bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
```
Install it
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton
```

### (Optional) Install bbb-demo
If you want to test the installation, you can install demos:
```bash
sudo apt-get install bbb-demo
```
Before testing, make sure you have set `secure: false` in `/usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/application.yml` file:
```yml
# ...
server:
    session:
        cookie:
            secure: false
# ...

```
You can access http://BBB_IP_ADDRESS , and you will be able to join bbb-demo
(probably WebRTC media won't work because it needs HTTPS to be set).
BBB_IP_ADDRESS is the ip address of your container/machine running this
installation.

## Setup HTTPS
Follow [2.2's Configure SSL on your BigBlueButton server](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/install.html#configure-ssl-on-your-bigbluebutton-server)

## Setup development environment
Follow [2.2's Setup a Development Environment](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/dev.html#setup-a-development-environment)

#### Additional steps for developing bbb-html5
Starting with BigBlueButton 2.3-alpha7 bbb-html5 clients sessions are handled by a pool of "frontend" bbb-html5 nodejs instances loadbalanced by NginX. When you are running the source code via `npm start` however, you are only running a single nodejs process and the loadbalancing configuration may be an obstacle. You would want to make a change in `/etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/bbb-html5.nginx` so you do not use the html5 pool but rather only the 4100 port.

The default - used for production mode:
```
location ~ ^/html5client/ {
  # proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4100; # use for development
  proxy_pass http://poolhtml5servers; # use for production
  ...
```

Development mode, only port 4100 is used.
```
location ~ ^/html5client/ {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4100; # use for development
  # proxy_pass http://poolhtml5servers; # use for production
  ...
```

After this change, reload NginX's configuration with `sudo systemctl reload nginx`

A symptom of running `npm start` with the incompatible `poolhtml5servers` NginX configuration is seeing `It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port.` and `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected Identifier`



When you switch back to running the `bbb-html5` packaged version you would want to revert your change so the `poolhtml5servers` are used for spreading the load of the client sessions.

BigBlueButton 2.3-alpha7 also introduced [bigbluebutton-html5/deploy_to_usr_share.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/v2.3-alpha-7/bigbluebutton-html5/deploy_to_usr_share.sh) - a script which deploys your [customized] bigbluebutton-html5/* code as locally running `bbb-html5` package (production mode, requiring the `poolhtml5servers` NginX rule)

## Known Problems
BigBlueButton 2.3-dev uses Java 8; however, Ubuntu 18.04 ships with Java 11 set as default option.  If you see something similar while trying to compile bbb-common-messages or bbb-apps-akka:

```
[error] /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-common-message/src/main/java/org/bigbluebutton/common2/redis/RedisStorageService.java:25:1: package com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations is not visible
[error]   (package com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations is declared in module java.xml, which does not export it)
[error] import com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations.Bool;
```

You can use [update-java-alternatives --list](https://askubuntu.com/a/740782) to switch to Java 8 version as default.


# Giving feedback and reporting bugs

BigBlueButton 2.3-dev is under active development.  While we don't recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on [our bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).  

If you found a reproducible bug,  please report it in the [GitHub Issues section](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues) with steps to reproduce (this will make it easier for the developers to fix the bug).  Indicate in the body of the bug report that this applies to BigBlueButton 2.3-dev and give us the client build number, which you can find either with `dpkg -l | grep bbb-html5` or within the client in the `Settings -> About` menu.
