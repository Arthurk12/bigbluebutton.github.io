# Features

## New player for recordings

The player is a complete rewrite that gives the user much more control and navigation when viewing a recording.  It offers a react-based player that gives the user the ability to search, view both webcam and screen share/presentation, and integrated shard notes.

<img src="/images/22-playback-overview.png" alt="Overview" />

The react-based player will playback on iOS and Android phones and tablets.

The presentation area displays the current slide or screenshare.

### Layout controls

The layout controls in the upper right-hand corner

<img src="/images/22-playback-layout.png" alt="Layout" />

let you quickly

  * do a full-text search of all slides in the recording
  * swap the webcam area with the presentation area
  * view presentation area full-screen

### Slide thumbnails

All slides in the recording appear as a row of thumbnails below the presentation area.  The highlighted thumbnail shows the current slide in the playback.

<img src="/images/22-playback-thumb.png" alt="Thumbnails" />

You can click on any slide to jump to that segment of the playback.  

<img src="/images/22-playback-thumbnails.png" alt="Thumbnails" />

Any screenshare sessions will appear as a screenshare icon.

### Show chat/shared notes

The chat area shows all the chat/shared notes for the session.

<img src="/images/22-playback-chat.png" alt="Chat" width="50%">

Click the shared notes and chat icons to switch between the views.  The shared notes shows the final state of shared notes when the recording ended.

Each chat message is clickable.  Clicking on a chat message jumps to the moment that chat message appeared in the session.  Poll results now appear in the chat as well.

### Search

Clicking the magnifying glass icon will bring up a dialog box that will display all slides that contain text matching the current search field.

<img src="/images/22-playback-search2.png" alt="Search" width="50%">

Here there is only one slide that has the word 'avoc'.  Clicking the search icon will only show only those matching slides on the thumbnail row below, making it easy to navigate to all slides that match the given text.

<img src="/images/22-playback-results.png" alt="Search" width="50%">

### Playback speed

You can click the playback speed icon on the playback controls to adjust the playback speed.

# Installation

For server requirements, BigBlueButton 2.3-dev needs the same [minimum server requirements](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/install.html#minimum-server-requirements) as 2.2, with the following differences

  * Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit
  * docker (Libreoffice now runs within a docker container)

The requirement for docker may preclude running 2.3-dev within some virtualized environments, such as LXC and containerd; however, it ensures libreoffice runs within a restrited sandbox for document conversion.  We are exploring if we can run libreoffice within systemd (such as systemd-nspawn).

The following command uses [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) to install BigBlueButton 2.3-dev using `bbb.example.com` as the hostname and `notice@example.com` as the email for Let's Encrypt (you would substitute these values for your own hostname and email address).  Notice the version is `-v bionic-230-dev`, which will install the latest build of BigBlueButto 2.3-dev.

```bash
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v bionic-230-dev -s bbb.example.com -e notice@example.com  -a -w
```

After installation finishes, you should see the following installed packages (your version numbers may be slightly different).

```bash
# dpkg -l | grep bbb-
ii  bbb-apps-akka             2.3.0-21        all      BigBlueButton Apps (Akka)
ii  bbb-config                1:2.3.0-21      amd64    BigBlueButton configuration utilities
ii  bbb-demo                  1:2.3.0-2       amd64    BigBlueButton API demos
ii  bbb-etherpad              1:2.3.0-13      amd64    The EtherPad Lite components for BigBlueButton
ii  bbb-freeswitch-core       2:2.3.0-7       amd64    BigBlueButton build of FreeSWITCH
ii  bbb-freeswitch-sounds     1:1.6.7-1       amd64    FreeSWITCH Sounds
ii  bbb-fsesl-akka            2.3.0-11        all      BigBlueButton FS-ESL (Akka)
ii  bbb-html5                 1:2.3.0-1311    amd64    The HTML5 components for BigBlueButton
ii  bbb-libreoffice-docker    1:2.3.0-7       amd64    BigBlueButton setup for LibreOffice running in docker
ii  bbb-mkclean               1:0.8.7-1       amd64    Clean and optimize Matroska and WebM files
ii  bbb-playback-presentation 1:2.3.0-6       amd64    BigBluebutton playback of presentation
ii  bbb-record-core           1:2.3.0-11      amd64    BigBlueButton record and playback
ii  bbb-web                   1:2.3.0-25      amd64    BigBlueButton API
ii  bbb-webrtc-sfu            1:2.3.0-9       amd64    BigBlueButton WebRTC SFU
```

This installs the latest version of BigBlueButton 2.3-dev with Let's encrypt certificate and the API demos.  With the API demos installed, you can oepn https://<hostname>/ in a browser (where <hostname> is the hostname you specified in the `bbb-install.sh` command), enter your name, and click 'Join' to join 'Demo Meeting'.  For more information, see the [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) documentation.


# Customizations

## Increase number of processes for nodejs
One of the improvements in scalability was to move away from a single nodejs process for bbb-html5 and have multiple nodejs processes handle the incoming messages from clients.  On BigBlueButton servers, this meant that bbb-html5 could use multiple CPU cores for processing messages and handling browser sessions (each nodejs process runs on a single CPU core).

As of [2.3-alpha-7](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.3-alpha-7) multiple bbb-html5 nodejs processes are enabled by default. Unless you modify `/usr/share/meteor/bundle/bbb-html5-with-roles.conf` and change the defaults, you will have 2 "backend" and two "frontend" processes. Using multiple nodejs processes with this setup allows for large meetings' load to be spread over multiple processes, providing better experience for users and providing support for higher number of users on powerful servers. A restart of BigBlueButton is required for the `bbb-html5-with-roles.conf` changes to take place.

#### Frontend(s):
 - receive the `ValidateAuthTokenResp` event to complete authentication
 - collection subscription and publishing
 - other DDP events including method calls to send events to Akka Apps
 - handle completely the Streamer redis events: Cursor, Annotations, External video share
 - still require MeetingStarted and MeetingEnded events to create/destroy per-meeting event processing queues

#### Backend(s):
 - handle all the non-streamer events
 - if more than one backend is running, bbb-web splits the load in round-robin fashion by assigning an 'instanceId'. So individual backends only process redis events for the meetings matching the process' instanceId
 - ValidateAuthTokenResp - is passed to backends as well, which is needed for the cases where you only have a backend, no frontends - for example dev environments that do not need to care about scaling



When you use `sudo bbb-conf --setip <hostname>` or `sudo bbb-conf --restart`, `bbb-conf` will run `/etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-conf/apply-config.sh` between shutdown and restart of the BigBlueButton processes.  In this way, you can change configuration values of BigBlueButton, or use some of the helper funtions in `apply-lib.sh`.  See [Automatically apply configuration changes on restart](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/customize.html#automatically-apply-configuration-changes-on-restart).


## Increase number of recording workers

The previous versions of BigBlueButton used a single thread for processing recordings.  BigBlueButton 2.3-dev uses [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) to spawn multiple recording workers for processing recordings.  

By default, `/usr/lib/systemd/system/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service` defines one recording worker `Environment=COUNT=1`.  

```
[Unit]
Description=BigBlueButton resque worker for recordings

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/rake -f ../Rakefile resque:workers >> /var/log/bigbluebutton/bbb-rap-worker.log'
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts
Environment=QUEUE=rap:archive,rap:publish,rap:process,rap:sanity,rap:captions
Environment=COUNT=1
# Environment=VVERBOSE=1
User=bigbluebutton
Restart=always
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

If you want 3 recording workers, for example, the steps below show how to add a systemd override file in `/etc/systemd/system/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service.d/override.conf` that sets `Environment=COUNT=3` and restarts the `bbb-rap-resque-worker.service` service.


```
# mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service.d
# cat > override.conf << HERE
[Service]
Environment=COUNT=3
HERE
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl restart bbb-rap-resque-worker.service
# systemctl status bbb-rap-resque-worker.service
● bbb-rap-resque-worker.service - BigBlueButton resque worker for recordings
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
  Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service.d

    Tasks: 15 (limit: 4915)
   CGroup: /system.slice/bbb-rap-resque-worker.service
      ├─23630 /bin/sh -c /usr/bin/rake -f ../Rakefile resque:workers >> /var/log/bigbluebutton/bbb-rap-worker.log

      └─23652 resque-2.0.0: Waiting for rap:archive,rap:publish,rap:process,rap:sanity,rap:captions

```

`systemctl status bbb-rap-resque-worker.service` shows three resque workers ready to process upto three recordings in parallel.

## Run three Kurento servers

Recommend running [three parallel Kurento servers](/2.2/customize.html#run-three-parallel-kurento-media-servers).


# Setup development environment
A few considerations before we start:
 - Required OS: Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic)
 - This is intended to run on containers/local-machine setup, such as LXC.
 - This process is similar to BBB 2.2's install. One difference is that we
 encapsulated Libreoffice in docker for increased security.
 - For public/production servers, we recommend installing BigBlueButton using
 [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install)



We'll do this in 3 steps:
* [Install BBB **2.3-dev** (detailed below)](#install-bbb-23-dev)
* [Setup SSL (same as 2.2)](#setup-https)
* [Setup development environment (same as 2.2)](#setup-development-environment-1)


## Install BBB 2.3-dev

### Install basic deps
Install needed tools
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install curl wget net-tools software-properties-common haveged apt-transport-https openjdk-8-jdk -y
```
Add needed repositories
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bigbluebutton/support -y
```
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rmescandon/yq -y
```
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa
```
Upgrade packages
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

### Install MongoDB
##### (Note: BBB 2.3-dev uses MongoDB 4.2, while BBB 2.2 uses MongoDB 3.4)
Add key for MongoDB's repository
```bash
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
Add APT's source for MongoDB
```bash
echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.2 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.2.list
```
Install MongoDB
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
```


### Install Node.js
##### (Note: BBB 2.3-dev uses Node.js 12.x, while BBB 2.2 uses Node.js 8.x)
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```


### Install Kurento Media Server
##### (Note: BBB 2.3-dev uses Kurento Media Server official's repository, instead of forked version. The current version used by BBB 2.3-dev is 6.15.0)
Add key for Kurento

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 5AFA7A83
```
Add APT's source
```bash
sudo tee "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kurento.list" >/dev/null <<EOF
# Kurento Media Server - Release packages
deb [arch=amd64] http://ubuntu.openvidu.io/6.15.0 bionic kms6
EOF
```
Install it
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kurento-media-server
```


### Install BigBlueButton
Add key for BigBlueButton
```bash
wget https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/repo/bigbluebutton.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
```
Add APT's source for BigBlueButton
```bash
echo "deb https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bionic-230-dev bigbluebutton-bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
```
Install it
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton
```

### (Optional) Install bbb-demo
If you want to test the installation, you can install demos:
```bash
sudo apt-get install bbb-demo
```
Before testing, make sure you have set `secure: false` in `/usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/application.yml` file:
```yml
# ...
server:
    session:
        cookie:
            secure: false
# ...

```
You can access http://BBB_IP_ADDRESS , and you will be able to join bbb-demo
(probably WebRTC media won't work because it needs HTTPS to be set).
BBB_IP_ADDRESS is the ip address of your container/machine running this
installation.

## Setup HTTPS
Follow [2.2's Configure SSL on your BigBlueButton server](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/install.html#configure-ssl-on-your-bigbluebutton-server)

## Setup development environment
Follow [2.2's Setup a Development Environment](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/dev.html#setup-a-development-environment)

#### Additional steps for developing bbb-html5
Starting with BigBlueButton 2.3-alpha7 bbb-html5 clients sessions are handled by a pool of "frontend" bbb-html5 nodejs instances loadbalanced by NginX. When you are running the source code via `npm start` however, you are only running a single nodejs process and the loadbalancing configuration may be an obstacle. You would want to make a change in `/etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/bbb-html5.nginx` so you do not use the html5 pool but rather only the 4100 port.

The default - used for production mode:
```
location ~ ^/html5client/ {
  # proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4100; # use for development
  proxy_pass http://poolhtml5servers; # use for production
  ...
```

Development mode, only port 4100 is used.
```
location ~ ^/html5client/ {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4100; # use for development
  # proxy_pass http://poolhtml5servers; # use for production
  ...
```

After this change, reload NginX's configuration with `sudo systemctl reload nginx`
When you switch back to running the `bbb-html5` packaged version you would want to revert your change so the `poolhtml5servers` are used for spreading the load of the client sessions.

BigBlueButton 2.3-alpha7 also introduced [bigbluebutton-html5/deploy_to_usr_share.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/v2.3-alpha-7/bigbluebutton-html5/deploy_to_usr_share.sh) - a script which deploys your [customized] bigbluebutton-html5/* code as locally running `bbb-html5` package (production mode, requiring the `poolhtml5servers` NginX rule)

## Known Problems
BigBlueButton 2.3-dev uses Java 8; however, Ubuntu 18.04 ships with Java 11 set as default option.  If you see something similar while trying to compile bbb-common-messages or bbb-apps-akka:

```
[error] /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-common-message/src/main/java/org/bigbluebutton/common2/redis/RedisStorageService.java:25:1: package com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations is not visible
[error]   (package com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations is declared in module java.xml, which does not export it)
[error] import com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.operations.Bool;
```

You can use [update-java-alternatives --list](https://askubuntu.com/a/740782) to switch to Java 8 version as default.


# Giving feedback and reporting bugs

BigBlueButton 2.3-dev is under active development.  While we don't recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on [our bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).  

If you found a reproducible bug,  please report it in the [GitHub Issues section](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues) with steps to reproduce (this will make it easier for the developers to fix the bug).  Indicate in the body of the bug report that this applies to BigBlueButton 2.3-dev and give us the client build number, which you can find either with `dpkg -l | grep bbb-html5` or within the client in the `Settings -> About` menu.
