# Overview

This document gives you an overview of BigBlueButton 2.4, the upcoming release of BigBlueButton.

## Timeline

We aim to have a much shorter release cycle for BigBlueButton 2.4 (compared to our previous releases).

May-June 2021 - development

July 2021 - beta versions

August 2021 - release candidates

September 2021 - official release (2.4.0) and afterwards minor releases (2.4.1, etc.) with security updates + bug fixes

## What's new

BigBlueButton 2.4 offers users improved usability, increased engagement, and more performance.

- **Usability** - making common functions (such as raise hand) easier
- **Engagement** - giving the instructor more ways to engage students
- **Performance** - increasing overall performance and scalability

Here's a breakdown of what's new in 2.4

- **Usability**

  - Ability to extend the duration of ongoing breakout rooms
  - Ability to set the name of the breakout rooms as you create them
  - Reduced mirror effect when sharing screen
  - Improved view of external video sharing for viewers
  - Recording includes polling result
  - Moderator messages in the public chat are easier to distinguish
  - Webcam background blur

- **Engagement**

  - Improved Layout Manager with focus on presentation vs focus on webcams
  - Presenter can set viewers' layout
  - Hide voter's name from moderators
  - Indicate who is sharing webcam

- **Performance**

This release, by design, does not introduce any large-scale UI changes. We designed it to be very familiar to users of BigBlueButton 2.3.

Under the hood, BigBlueButton 2.4 installs on Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit and the following dependencies are upgraded compared to BigBlueButton 2.3

- Java 11 (over Java 8)
- meteor 2.2

# Features

The following sections give details of the new features.

## Usability

### Ability to extend the duration of ongoing breakout rooms

As a moderator you can see the Extend button at the bottom of the Breakouts panel:

<br /><br />

Selecting it will display the controls to extend the breakouts time by five or minutes or longer.

<br /><br />

The time is added to all running breakout rooms.

<br /><br />

### Ability to set the name of the breakout rooms as you create them

### Reduced mirror effect when sharing screen

Up to and including BigBlueButton 2.3.x the HTML5 client would show mirror effect to the presenter when the presenter was sharing their entire window. This caused confusion and was often interpreted as a bug.

<br /><br />

In BigBlueButton 2.4 we have introduced a simplified screen which informs the presenter of which window is shared, without creating mirror effect.

<br /><br />

### Improved view of external video sharing for viewers

### Recording includes polling result

### Moderator messages in the public chat are easier to distinguish

Chat messages sent by moderators stand out in the public chat, allowing to be distinguished easily. The emphasis is optional (settings.yml chat parameter `moderatorChatEmphasized`)

<br /><br />

### Webcam background blur

## Engagement

### Improved Layout Manager

### Presenter can set viewers' layout

### Hide voter's name from moderators

BigBlueButton 2.4 supports pseudo-anonymous polls - meaning polls for which the presenter/moderator is not informed about the voting option of the viewers. Server administrators (anyone with access to the BigBlueButton server) can still find information to connect the answer to the user. Big thanks to @tibroc and @schrd who sent pull requests for this feature!

Set the poll to be "anonymous" when creating it:

<br /><br />

Voters will see that it is anonymous:

<br /><br />

The presenter will not know who voted what:

<br /><br />

### Indicate who is sharing webcam

BigBlueButton 2.4 introduces an idicator for users who are sharing their webcam. This is particularly helpful when webcam pagination is enabled there is no way of knowing whose webcam you would see on the other "pages".

## Installation

For server requirements, BigBlueButton 2.4 needs similar [minimum server requirements](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.3/install.html#minimum-server-requirements) as 2.3.

To install 2.4, use [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install). For example, the following command installs BigBlueButton 2.4-dev using `bbb.example.com` as the hostname and `notice@example.com` as the email for Let's Encrypt (you would substitute these values for your own hostname and email address). Notice the version is `-v bionic-240`, which will install the latest release (alpha/beta/etc) of BigBlueButton 2.4-dev that was released from branch `v2.4.x-release`. If you instead use `-v bionic-24-dev`, you will be installing/updating to the very latest build tracking the source code from branch `develop`.

```bash
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v bionic-240 -s bbb.example.com -e notice@example.com  -a -w
```

After installation finishes, you should see the following installed packages (your version numbers may be slightly different).

```bash
# dpkg -l | grep bbb-
ii  bbb-apps-akka             2.4.0-10     all    BigBlueButton Apps (Akka)
ii  bbb-config                1:2.4.0-9    amd64  BigBlueButton configuration utilities

ii  bbb-webrtc-sfu            1:2.4.0-5    amd64  BigBlueButton WebRTC SFU
```

This installs the latest version of BigBlueButton 2.4-dev with Let's encrypt certificate and the API demos. With the API demos installed, you can open https://<hostname>/ in a browser (where <hostname> is the hostname you specified in the `bbb-install.sh` command), enter your name, and click 'Join' to join 'Demo Meeting'. For more information, see the [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) documentation.

BigBlueButton 2.4-dev is under active development. While we don't recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on [our bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

## Development

You can follow the same instructions as in [development for 2.3](/2.3/dev.html) at this point, just make sure to use the 2.4 repository for packages mentioned above, `bionic-24-dev`, and pull from GitHub branch `develop` [from the BigBlueButton's repository](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/branches)
Once we upgrade to Java 11 there will be additional instructions.
