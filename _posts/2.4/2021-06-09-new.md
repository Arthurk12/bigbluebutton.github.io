# Overview

We aim to have a much shorter release cycle for BigBlueButton 2.4 (compared to our previous releases).

May-June 2021 - development

July 2021 - beta versions

August 2021 - release candidates

September 2021 - official release (2.4.0) and afterwards minor releases (2.4.1, etc.) with security updates + bug fixes

# Features

The following sections give details of the new features.

## Usability

### Ability to extend the duration of ongoing breakout rooms

As a moderator you can see the Extend button at the bottom of the Breakouts panel:
<img src="/images/24-extend-breakout-1.png" alt="Extend breakout" />
<br /><br />

Selecting it will display the controls to extend the breakouts time by five or minutes or longer.
<img src="/images/24-extend-breakout-2.png" alt="Extend breakout" />
<br /><br />

The time is added to all running breakout rooms.
<img src="/images/24-extend-breakout-3.png" alt="Extend breakout" />
<br /><br />

### Ability to set the name of the breakout rooms as you create them

When creating breakout rooms you can edit the name of each room
<img src="/images/24-breakout-name-1.png" alt="Set name for breakout" />
<br /><br />

<img src="/images/24-breakout-name-2.png" alt="Set name for breakout" />
<br /><br />
### Reduced mirror effect when sharing screen

Up to and including BigBlueButton 2.3.x the HTML5 client would show mirror effect to the presenter when the presenter was sharing their entire window. This caused confusion and was often interpreted as a bug.
<img src="/images/24-reduced-mirror-effect-before.png" alt="Reduced mirror effect" />
<br /><br />

In BigBlueButton 2.4 we have introduced a simplified screen which informs the presenter of which window is shared, without creating mirror effect.
<img src="/images/24-reduced-mirror-effect-after.png" alt="Reduced mirror effect" />
<br /><br />

### Improved view of external video sharing for viewers

### Recording's public chat includes polling result

Meetings which included polling have improved poll results summary in the recording.

<img src="/images/24-recording-polling-result.png" alt="Recording - polling result" />
<br /><br />

### Recording's public chat includes links to external videos shared in the meeting

Meetings which included external video sharing (YouTube, Vimeo, etc) have links to the video resource in the recording's public chat.

<img src="/images/24-recording-external-video.png" alt="Recording - external video" />
<br /><br />

### Moderator messages in the public chat are easier to distinguish

Chat messages sent by moderators stand out in the public chat, allowing to be distinguished easily. The emphasis is optional (settings.yml chat parameter `moderatorChatEmphasized`)

<img src="/images/24-chat-font-moderator.png" alt="Moderator bolded text" />
<br /><br />

### Webcam background blur

In the webcam preview window prior to sharing webcam you can select between several backgrounds (or no background blur)

No blur (default)

<br /><br />

Replacing the background

<br /><br />

Blurring the background

<br /><br />

## Engagement

### Improved Layout Manager

Under Settings there is a new section of controls related to layout. A dropdown allows for the selection of one of: Smart Layout, Focus on presentation or Focus on webcams.

<img src="/images/24-layout-dropdown.png" alt="Layout dropdown" />
<br /><br />

Focus on presentation - webcams are visible but more compact, allowing for the majority of the area to be reserved for the presentation. Focus on video has the reverse effect - the presentation is visible but on small area under the chat.

<img src="/images/24-focus-on-presentation.png" alt="Layout" />
<br /><br />
### Presenter can set viewers' layout

The presenter has an extra set of controls in the Settings modal. Aside from being able to set their own layout, there is an extra option to "push" that layout to the rest of the participants in the meeting.

<br /><br />

### Learning Dashboard

Teachers (moderators) are able to monitor student's (viewers) activity throughout the session.  The Learning Dashboard gives moderators an additional full-page, live view (updated every 10 seconds) of user activity that includes

- When they joined the session
- How long there have been in the session
- Time talking
- Time sharing their webcam
- How many messages, emojis, and raise hand events
- current status (online/offline)
- Response to all polls

Moderators (teachers) can use this dashboard to track student engagement during the session, aswering questions such as 

 - How long has each student been in the session?
 - How has been active in the session?
 - What was the responses to previous polling questions?

Moderators can launch the Learning Dashboard by selecting "Learning Dashboard" under the gear icon.

<img src="/images/24-learning-dashboard.png" alt="Learning Dashboard" />
<br /><br />

The learning dashboard is under active development.  Here it shows three (3) participants, two (2) polls, one raise hand, and overall activity score (calculated based on who is most active in talking, chatting, responding polls, using emojis, and raising hands).

This screen shot shows the overall Active Participants (sorted by name)
<img src="/images/24-learning-dashboard-2.png" alt="Learning Dashboard-2" />
<br /><br />

This screen shot shows each user's response to polls.  Note: Anonymous is for any poll that the instructors indicated would be anonymous and not track user's responses.

<img src="/images/24-learning-dashboard-3.png" alt="Learning Dashboard-3" />
<br /><br />

### Hide voter's name from moderators

BigBlueButton 2.4 supports pseudo-anonymous polls - meaning polls for which the presenter/moderator is not informed about the voting option of the viewers. Server administrators (anyone with access to the BigBlueButton server) can still find information to connect the answer to the user. Big thanks to @tibroc and @schrd who sent pull requests for this feature!

Set the poll to be "anonymous" when creating it:
<img src="/images/24-anonymous-poll-1.png" alt="Anonymous poll" />
<br /><br />

Voters will see that it is anonymous:
<img src="/images/24-anonymous-poll-2.png" alt="Anonymous poll" />
<br /><br />

The presenter will not know who voted what:
<img src="/images/24-anonymous-poll-3.png" alt="Anonymous poll" />
<br /><br />

### Indicate who is sharing webcam

BigBlueButton 2.4 introduces an idicator for users who are sharing their webcam. This is particularly helpful when webcam pagination is enabled there is no way of knowing whose webcam you would see on the other "pages".

<img src="/images/24-webcam-indicator.png" alt="Anonymous poll" />
<br /><br />

## Installation

For server requirements, BigBlueButton 2.4 needs similar [minimum server requirements](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.3/install.html#minimum-server-requirements) as 2.3.

To install 2.4, use [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install). For example, the following command installs BigBlueButton 2.4-dev using `bbb.example.com` as the hostname and `notice@example.com` as the email for Let's Encrypt (you would substitute these values for your own hostname and email address). Notice the version is `-v bionic-240`, which will install the latest release (alpha/beta/etc) of BigBlueButton 2.4-dev that was released from branch `v2.4.x-release`. If you instead use `-v bionic-24-dev`, you will be installing/updating to the very latest build tracking the source code from branch `develop`.

```bash
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v bionic-240 -s bbb.example.com -e notice@example.com  -a -w
```

After installation finishes, you should see the following installed packages (your version numbers may be slightly different).

```bash
# dpkg -l | grep bbb-
ii  bbb-apps-akka             2.4.0-10     all    BigBlueButton Apps (Akka)
ii  bbb-config                1:2.4.0-9    amd64  BigBlueButton configuration utilities

```

This installs the latest version of BigBlueButton 2.4-dev with Let's encrypt certificate and the API demos. With the API demos installed, you can open https://<hostname>/ in a browser (where <hostname> is the hostname you specified in the `bbb-install.sh` command), enter your name, and click 'Join' to join 'Demo Meeting'. For more information, see the [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) documentation.

BigBlueButton 2.4-dev is under active development. While we don't recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on [our bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

## Development

You can follow the same instructions as in [development for 2.3](/2.3/dev.html) at this point, just make sure to use the 2.4 repository for packages mentioned above, `bionic-24-dev`, and pull from GitHub branch `develop` [from the BigBlueButton's repository](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/branches)
