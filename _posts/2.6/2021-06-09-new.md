# Overview

This document gives you an overview of BigBlueButton 2.6, the latest version of BigBlueButton now in development.

*Note:* This document is DRAFT and will be expanded upon as 2.6 development goes through alpha, beta, and release.

BigBlueButton 2.6 offers users improved usability, increased engagement, and more performance.

Here's a breakdown of what's new in 2.6.

### Improved Echo Test dialog

### Improved notification of recording start

The indicator for whether the recording is on has been made bigger. Additionally if you create your meeting with an optional parameter `notifyRecordingIsOn=true`, you users will see the following dialog when the recording commenses and also when joining a session that is already actively being recorded. You can choose to either continue or leave the session.
