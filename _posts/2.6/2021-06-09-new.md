# Overview

This document gives you an overview of BigBlueButton 2.6, the latest version of BigBlueButton now in development.

*Note:* This document is DRAFT and will be expanded upon as 2.6 development goes through alpha, beta, and release.

BigBlueButton 2.6 offers users improved usability, increased engagement, and more performance.

- **Usability** - making common functions (such as raise hand) easier
- **Engagement** - giving the instructor more ways to engage students
- **Performance** - increasing overall performance and scalability

Here's a breakdown of what's new in 2.6.

## Usability

### Dark theme

BigBlueButton supports dark theme. To enable it just navigate to the Settings.

### Improved Echo Test dialog
The echo test modal has added a new audio stream volume indicator in place of the
separate confirmation screen. This reduced the number of views and interactions required for audio confirmation.

### Improved notification of recording start

The indicator for whether the recording is on has been made bigger. Additionally if you create your meeting with an optional parameter `notifyRecordingIsOn=true`, you users will see the following dialog when the recording commenses and also when joining a session that is already actively being recorded. You can choose to either continue or leave the session.

<br /><br />

### Allow pinning of more than one webcam

The pinning feature prevents the webcams from being rotated out when audio floor switching is activated.
This functionality is specially important for document and/or interpreter cameras. It has also been improved
to support miltiple pinned cameras.

### Upload your own webcam background

This new feature allows a user to upload virtual background image's for their webcam. The user can upload 
and delete images at will.

Allows the ability to adjust the brightness levels of their webcam (or) webcam and background image.

This is done via the webcam settings modal using the brightness slider at the bottom.

### Improved layouts manager selection

### Live Automatic Closed Captions

### Downloading presentation with whiteboard annotations included

Teachers can now export their slide decks with the annotations added during a lesson.
Selecting "Send to chat" in the presentation upload modal sends a link in the public chat from which meeting participants can download the file.

### Upload a presentation straight from NextCloud

Two new create parameters: uploadExternalDescription and uploadExternalUrl have been introduced.

The client supports these parameters, displaying a message in the presentation upload modal when both values are set at meeting creation.
